            Yes, excuses. Before I continue, if you haven’t read the first part of this series please do so, it is going to enhance how much you can understand this article. If you are already caught up, I’ll start afresh.

            Again: Yes, excuses! Excuses are some of the instances in which people discover their inner brilliance. People are able to come up with theories that define the entirety of existence when scrambling for reasons why they cannot do something. “She was able to do it because she is naturally smart,” those are the words of a Form 1 student (an 8th grader) who already has figured out the theory of genetics. Most people are able to devise the theory of genetics, economics, relativity, and other complex subjects if it helps them make one point to come across: that they can't do it. Does it mean anyone can do anything? Simple, yes. Always. But it also depends. What we need to understand is that we can achieve the same results but not the way we thought we were going to do so. To explain this, we can ask whether a human can fly. Yes, a human can fly, millions fly each week. Although, we are not birds, we fly in tubes with comfortable seats with the best breathing air you can get – not wings. If you are still wondering, I am referring to an aeroplane.

              "MaSwati, again I am not saying we cannot get better, and I do not imply we aren’t doing anything productive what I am getting at is, even if the battle is lost but the war is not over."

          </div>

        <p>
            The case I am trying to make is rooted in the mindset we have as a people. I cannot directly trace where we lost the ambition of becoming better. We are getting better, yes, however, I am not convinced that we are willing to stand out as a country. It is obviously not a competition against other countries, and maybe, as a country, we are satisfied right here, where we are. I am hardly persuaded by that either. Thousands are living in poverty and if I were them, I would like to get out of that situation. This is why, according to the United Nations, the poverty line is below 2 dollars a day per person (30 rands), in eSwatini, there are families living below that – not just an individual but families. That is horrible news. Not to be swayed too far from the subject, I am sure that having a national goal will give us urgency to address those issues. By raising our standards, we will not tolerate having people living in such conditions. If necessary, we will hold each other's hands and pull each other gently out of poverty, one person at a time. If we thought at some point, “We can be a developed country.” We can still think like that again. With that ambition, we could ask ourselves how we can address the obstacles standing in our way. Having a goal encourages thinking and action. It keeps us focused and we wander less around useless things.

            MaSwati, again I am not saying we cannot get better, and I do not imply we aren’t doing anything productive what I am getting at is, even if the battle is lost but the war is not over. We may have sailed the vision 2022 downstream and let it to be devoured forever. However, that is not the end of eSwatini. The truth is that the dream was the King’s, and people have varying attitudes towards that. The fact that the dream shattered into pieces gives joy to some of emaSwati because, maybe, the monarch would no longer have a strong hold over the land of emaSwati. I hope we have realized that as eSwatini we can lose anything, this time it was a goal. Through this experience we have learnt that we could lose a lot of things, including a goal. It is a lesson for other people, and we need to protect a goal once we have it and move on once we lose it. We need to become strong in times of loss and be grateful for what we still have left – we have not lost it all. Not even close. We still have potential that we need to realize and then act on. We need to tap veins we haven’t tapped before and grow in confidence in our abilities.

            Confidence is free and available to all of us. Eswatini, for me is a country with potential, and, beyond that, it is a great country. I do not like having to explain to people what eSwatini is when the only way is when it has to be in relation to South Africa or Mozambique. I utterly detest the notion of African food because I know that as emaSwati we are different. Our food is different, our culture is different, our music, our vibe and minds are different from other African countries. What I see though is that we perpetually hide our tails between our legs and adapt to other cultures in order to fit in. We act like chameleons and adopt people’s food, music and lifestyle. I think we should own eSwatini. I think we should preserve our culture; I am not referring to the textbook culture that is used for tourism. We have our uniqueness and distinct identity that nobody knows about. It is up to us to let our light shine. We are not South Africa or any other country. We are emaSwati! We must search deep within ourselves and start creating and revolutionizing. What is our music, food, and lifestyle? For instance, we can inquire how is a Swazi party different from a South African party? When we find the answers, we embrace them.

            </p>
          </div>

        <p>
            Confidence can be our strength if we use it. First World country citizens think of themselves as First World country citizens. Their thoughts and hearts are confident that they deserve that level of development. Are we supposed to lie to ourselves that we are a developed country and then we’ll reach that status? Absolutely not. That would be a big joke, a farce that we as a country could put ourselves through. What we could do is embrace that we are on our way. Confidence will be a valuable resource to whatever we set out to do. Be ready to educate people about eSwatini, be ready to explore eSwatini, be ready to embrace eSwatini, and most of all be ready to have the love of the country. We are not there yet, we are very far I might add, but every step is more meaningful if we are confident. If we say, “Yes, eSwatini is moving forward.” We will have the certainty that we might get there and become the country we will love. Sometimes, situations get worse before they get better and what helps us endure the worst moment is the faith and confidence in ourselves as an entity, not a carbon copy of anything else.

          </div>

        <p>
            Following up on the idea that we should not copy other countries there are two things we also need to consider before I declare something way above my pay grade. First, most of the developed countries are built through oppression and inhumane treatment of Africans and other races. I may have said earlier that I could not trace where our pride died but I assume that colonization had an enormous impact on our confidence and self-esteem. We do not see beyond what we are now. It is easy to think a white person is inherently better, that it makes sense why Americans are where they are. Well, they are not better, we are similar in capabilities, it is just that we have different pasts. We should not build our country like current superpowers; we should focus, rather, on fairness and equity because fairness and equity are vital for a stable future of emaSwati. It is optimal to build everything on a stable foundation not on the backs of other people – especially if it is exploiting them or underpaying them (though slaves were not paid). We cannot easily get over those years of inferiority and suppression, but we need to try. Another thing we need to acknowledge is the strength of a black person. If First World countries are built on our backs it means we have the potential to do it ourselves. The difference is, now we do it at will and we do it for ourselves. We can now “enslave” ourselves, each individual themselves, working hard, smart and with purpose to build a better country.

        <p>
            I am sure that to many I am being superficial and naively optimistic because on paper it makes sense but in the real world it is harder. I know that and that is the point really, we quit before we try. We tend to not be confident in our abilities and we do not want to pave a new way as we progress in the 21st century. Second, we ought to be careful about what we mean about being unique and different. We should not hyperinflate that idea. We are not aiming to be different, but we aim to embrace the peculiarity we already possess, and we aim to make it, such that, it is to our advantage not a new obstacle. Some rules, in order to succeed, need not to be broken. To those rules we need to take a pragmatic approach and just follow them because that is how the world works. For example, we cannot expect to be developed if we do not put in more work than we are now, even if our mindset has changed. Even if we have the confidence and edge like developed countries, without working smart and hard, we will not realize our goals.

            Now, the time has come for me to stir controversy within emaSwati, but before we get there, I need to explain my thought process. Factually, we can all agree that making eSwatini a better place for emaSwati and other people living in it is a worthy ideal. I think we can also agree that we need a common goal for us to be able to focus and create a straight path towards success. Moreover, we must not set a goal that we can easily determine that it is impossible to achieve. We will have a tough time agreeing on the specifics of any dream we come up with. People have diverse needs, and some may think it is a privilege to even think this way. That argument is valid and sometimes true. However, I want us to have a new vision. I am calling out to all emaSwati and beyond, that we all take on this mission. I am not going to lay out specifics, but I think eSwatini needs a new ambition that I want to call, “Vision Eswatini.” It can be individualistic and, also, a national assignment. It makes one ask, “What one more thing can I, or can we do to make eSwatini better for an extended period of time?” There are many avenues to take part in. You could start a book club or support at least one local artist. We can have more social justice activists, political activists, and groups to address the rights of emaSwati. We can support local businesses and franchises more. We can improve technologically, educating and implementing modern ideas, so on and so forth. Lastly, be ready to work really hard to transform the country. And yes, I said it, Vision Eswatini!
