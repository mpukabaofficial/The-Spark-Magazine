      <p class="article-start">
        Yet again, welcome to the 4th edition of The Spark Magazine. As you
        begin to read this edition, you can check out our other editions out
        just to have a feel of what we are about. If you already have, I would
        like you to have a moment of self introspection right now. Ask yourself,
        “What will it take?” Maybe to live the life you want to live; to have
        the state of mind you desire; or maybe to have the relationships you
        need. I am certain that each one of us have dreams and desires and
        probably have read a couple of motivational quotes on Instagram that
        made us believe that we are capable of having it. Although, when we look
        into our lives, we are not doing that great. You might have been told
        that you are doing great but you know deep within where you are versus
        where you want to be. Presumably, you do not have goals at all and are
        waiting for your hour of death. This could be because you are numb to
        aspiration and it is much easier that way.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this edition we are attempting to remind everyone of the necessity
        for them to pursue their goals, dreams or healthy desires. It is not
        required for everyone to sit down and plan and introspect about what
        their really want. Intuitively, there is something we feel we should do
        at a moment, for example, greeting a person, an investment, a run, or
        inevitably planning. Our brains already know what we want and if we
        would not filter out or procrastinate those small tasks we are aware
        that our lives could be a little bit better. So why fear? Why
        procrastinate? Why hesitate? At the end of the day you know that you
        want it.

        Imagine waking up each day, brushing your teeth and taking a shower. For
        the 3rd month you have been consistently waking up on time. You have put
        enough effort to make each day a masterpiece. I believe that if you
        master your day, you master your week, then your month, your year,
        decade, unavoidably your life. Our days seem so insignificant that we
        throw them away, regularly, because we have another day called tomorrow.
        So why worry? We should worry because our days are building blocks of
        our lives. Imagine each day to be like each genetic code: it defines
        your life just like genes define how a person is. If one of the genes
        are damaged, a person can be easily susceptible to the worst of
        diseases. Even a momentary life. Is this the day that will be
        problematic your whole life (the bad gene)?

        In order for one to exponentiate their probability of stumbling into
        success, if I may, there is an urgent need to embrace focus. Everyday we
        are clouded by the need for our dopamine to be spiked. My assumption is
        that we are more distracted than past generations. I might be wrong but
        I think that across the board we must aim to have moment occupied by
        only one task – nothing else. That is difficult but beneficial. Our
        phones and other gadgets are detrimental to our success at the initial
        stages. Discipline is the driving force in ensuring complete focus on
        our work. Thereafter our focus should be on the right task, not just any
        task.
      </p>

        Sometimes it is easier to do all the above mentioned things whilst we
        put off what is fleetingly critical. We hide from the necessary task
        like prey from a predator. We procrastinate productively. Rather we do
        everything than that specific task. It makes sense because of the fear
        that it stirs inside us. One of the fundamental ways to know what to do
        is asking ourselves, “What do I fear the most?” and do it. Obviously we
        should not be naïve in our approach because some fears are necessary.
        Though, in most cases facing fear is the best option. Fear is our
        roadmap to freedom. Ultimately, to our success. Execution of this
        concept is also delicate: we need to move direct and quickly before we
        think too much about it.

        In continuation, we ought to take immediate action. It would bring
        greater joy if you decided to let go of this magazine right now to
        start, continue and/or finish an important task you have right now.
        Like. Right. Now! But do not feel bad because, by chance, reading this
        magazine could be that task. Even if it is not, that does not mean beat
        yourself up about not being able to today – although, I would rather you
        execute the task – live to fight another day.

        There are more tips and they are endless but to focus the introduction
        to what is important. As said in previous magazines, I believe that
        emaSwati should also focus on themselves. Because in our aim to become
        an ideal country we ought to be tough enough to put in the work. Just
        like the name, our aim is to ignite the spark of love for the nation
        despite and in spite of the conditions. To emphasize, it will take us to
        see it through, being the driving force for change in the country. We
        ought to strive with our blood and tears because it must happen. As you
        continue to read the magazine, focus on what you can do, how your dreams
        and goals are going to bring a positive change to liSwati, emaSwati and
        the country as a whole.
