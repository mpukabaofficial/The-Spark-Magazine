      <p class="article-start">
        We have already had the theme to this edition, simplicity, defined in
        the introduction. Of the many definitions of simplicity, one definition
        is also the ability to appreciate the small things in life. So, in this
        article simplicity will be, “Making a situation or problem seem less
        difficult or complicated than it really is.” That is according to the
        Oxford Dictionary, 2010. We’ll appreciate that life has seasons and that
        understanding that will enable us to live through all of them. It will
        make life more bearable because we will appreciate each season and its
        characteristics.

        You know seasons, right? You are familiar with spring, summer, autumn
        and winter – right? Everyone knows that! I’ll be honest here: there is a
        season I don’t like, and it is winter. The extreme cold makes being
        productive nearly impossible! I just hate that. I usually have no
        optimism, whatsoever, because I wake up grumpy asking myself whether it
        is really necessary to get out of bed straight to the chilly weather to
        fight this battle called life – and for the whole season? After I make
        it out of bed to get ready to face the day; I get out of my house and
        the breeze outside just chills my spine and I see the gloomy sight of
        dried-up leaves and trees. Gee! “Does life need to be this hard?” I
        question while rolling my eyes because the sight is just atrocious, the
        flowers are all dried up and the roads are dusty. It is a messed-up
        season, it is funny that the sun does not make it any warmer, and days
        are way shorter. It sure feels like it's a never-ending season and
        there's really nothing to appreciate about it.

        But then just before I realize it, it's spring! Flowers are blossoming,
        the sun's a bit warmer, the wind is not as cold and dry as the winter
        breeze. Then suddenly it all feels better, it feels like there's hope
        and the mornings cease to be a hassle. Then comes my favorite, summer!
        Most things are just bright, lively, and vibrant. It's warm and I get to
        dress up and look forward to the day with much more enthusiasm and
        enjoyment. As much as I appreciate how good summer makes me feel, it is
        not perfect either! Summer is also rainy resulting to mud and occasional
        chills and I do not like that. It just feels much easier and natural to
        appreciate the aspects I like about the season and erase the not so
        amusing parts whereas all the parts of the season are there for a
        purpose. Imagine there wasn't any rain, and we had no water to drink,
        cook or bath? That would be horrible, so then that just means in
        everything, whether good or bad, enjoyable, or not, there's always some
        goodness to it. There's goodness in the winter I don't like and there's
        also goodness in the rain I don't enjoy much, and of course there is
        goodness in a summer’s day which I enjoy very much.

        Enjoying summer relative to winter does not mean the summer season won't
        pass, leading us back to autumn, then the icy cold mornings of the
        winter. And simply because I don't enjoy the rain much, it does not mean
        that I do not need it and even if I didn’t it will still pour when its
        time comes. It is just the nature of seasons: they are never permanent;
        they are never uniform. We have a tendency as humans: to stress out when
        things don't go our way at the time we want them to – forgetting the
        behavior of seasons and time. When it's winter, no matter how much I can
        gripe and whine about the cold, it still is winter because it's that
        time of the year. No matter how much I can wish it can be over within 2
        days, but winter still lasts for three good months because it was
        designed that way. Doesn't that sound a bit familiar to our life
        situations that have seasons. We're always so quick to rejoice and be
        grateful for the summer, when all things are going our way and working
        out then the winter comes when it's all dry and cold then we get mad and
        wish for it to be over soon. But what if we'd be grateful for both
        seasons because trials and tribulations of winter help us to develop
        endurance and endurance develops strength of character. When our
        strength of character is developed then our faith and gratitude soars,
        then whether it's summer or winter, we can handle them like pros!

        The wisest man to have ever lived, King Solomon, wrote to us a personal
        book (Ecclesiastes) with wise nuggets to help us cope with the different
        seasons of our lives. His famous words being, "For everything there is a
        season, a time for everything under the heaven" (Ecclesiastes 3:1-8).
        These words help us to accept the reality of life, that it always won't
        go according to how we want it to go; it will be bad sometimes; but life
        has exceptional times too! But then, it won't always be fair, good,
        exciting, peaceful, sad, or gloomy. We will not always harvest or gather
        or embrace or mend or heal or dance or speak. Some days, we'll just have
        to be quiet, cry, grieve, tear, turn away, throw away and quit
        searching. Conversely, some days we'll have to plant, build up, gather,
        keep, search, seek knowledge and apply it, work on something, tend
        something, love something, love someone. And there'll also be times to
        let go. It's just seasons, and we must live in them, live through them,
        and not give up because it feels too hard to bear. For us is just to
        accept the way God does things because no one can straighten what he has
        made crooked and bear in mind that He is perfect and does things
        perfectly. Apostle Paul adds that, "The trials in your life are no
        different from what others experience and God is faithful and will not
        allow the temptation to be more than what you can stand. When you are
        tempted (or experience trials), He will show you a way out so that you
        can endure." (1 Corinthians 10:13).
      </p>

      <div class="quote quote-color-green dark">
        <p>
          "For us is just to accept the way God does things because no one can
          straighten what he has made crooked and bear in mind that He is
          perfect and does things perfectly."
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        So, for every season, learn to accept and understand it. When tough
        times come, realize that they both come from God. Remember that nothing
        is certain in this life. Those who are strong don't always win the race
        and those who are educated don't always lead successful lives, all is
        decided by chance and being at the right place at the right time. The
        good thing is that time and chance happen to all. That's fair! It's
        always up to us to choose what we do with the chance and time. This
        concludes it: all seasons are God made and are for us to either endure
        or enjoy. We should appreciate all the seasons because all things, work
        together for our good. And when chance and time knocks on our door, we
        should always choose right, choose wisely! Choose to work when it's time
        to work, learn when it's time to learn, relax when it's time to relax
        and cry when it's time to cry, be happy when it's time to be happy
        because nothing is permanent, and nothing is certain. That's the
        simplicity of the seasons.
