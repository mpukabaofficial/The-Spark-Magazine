          <span class="scenes">SCENE 1<br /></span>
          (MAX is shouting at CARLOS)
          <span class="characters"><br />MAX:</span> CARLOS! (bangs the wall
          separating them) Who in the world sets his alarm for 4am? Dude it’s
          only fricking first day. For the 100th time, shut that damn thing off
          before I lose myself!
          <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> Sorry man, I just
          overslept. I always wake up at this time…
          <span class="characters"><br />MAX:</span> No you don’t!
          <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> (muttering) Yes I do.
          <span class="characters"><br />MAX:</span> Just set it loud enough for
          you to hear it and do not allow it to ring for a long time. Sleep time
          is happy time for me, and if you disturb that we are not going to get
          along okay. You understand?
          <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> Yeah, I am sorry.
          (everyone in the room is moaning, waking up and they make irritated
          sounds)
        </p>
        <p class="breaks">
          <span class="break"><br />BREAK 1<br /></span>
          (Opens the shower curtain.)
          <span class="characters"><br />BOY 1:</span> Hey! What are you doing?
          (Quickly closes the curtain)I am in here.
          <span class="characters"><br />BOY 2:</span> I wanna shower. Can I
          join? (chuckles) <span class="characters"><br />BOY 1:</span> Fuck
          you! Rest of the guys in the bathroom laugh.
        </p>
        <p class="scene two">
          <span class="scenes"><br />SCENE 2 </span>
          <span class="characters"><br />GUS:</span> These shoelaces can’t even
          hold together? How more could I suffer? (he takes a deep breath; he
          continues talking to himself)This is not my day, ahhh shit…(there is a
          knock on his door) come in!
          <span class="characters"><br />MARTIN:</span> Bro its late what the…
          why are you still here? <span class="characters"><br />GUS:</span> I
          cannot tie these messed up shoelaces. Life is hard…
          <span class="characters"><br />MARTIN:</span> No time for games, let’s
          go! (Run out and the is a background sound of the hallway of the
          school and then he closes his locker)
          <span class="characters"><br />MARTIN:</span> We have Chemistry next;
          you took your history book. Come on man what are you doing?
          <span class="characters"><br />GUS:</span> Oh shit, I didn’t see… we
          are so late right now. I am sure that Lizzy will be pissed. I don’t
          see the poi… (he is pulled out)Leave me, do not pull me – I can walk
          for myself <span class="characters"><br />MARTIN:</span> I have no
          time to debate this with you. (raises his voice) stop acting weird!
        </p>
        <p class="scene three">
          <span class="scenes"><br />SCENE 3</span>
          (closing of locker)
          <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> Hey, again, I just want
          to apologize for how…
          <span class="characters"><br />THULILE:</span> For what?
          <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> For making you mad
          yesterday… <span class="characters"><br />THULILE:</span> I told you
          it is fine. <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> Oh okay
          cool, I am from the consent workshop. I really did not know anything
          about that when I came here. I am a new man now.
          <span class="characters"><br />THULILE:</span> Yeah, it is important
          to ask and ensure that a person is happy to do whatever you want to do
          with them. <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> So, you knew
          this before you came here?
          <span class="characters"><br />THULILE:</span> We were not taught at
          school, but in a way it is obvious that no one should be forced to do
          something they do not want to do.
          <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> I have another workshop
          coming up, orientation is sooo busy. (takes deep breath)…(short
          silence) but I want to hang out later on – would you like to talk
          later? <span class="characters"><br />THULILE:</span> (pauses too) If
          I am free, I have my EE to finish up.
          <span class="characters">CARLOS:</span> Maybe, I can help you take a
          break. We’ll meet in house 9, no?
          <span class="characters">THULILE:</span> You might be kidding.
          <span class="characters">CARLOS:</span> Okay, at the cafeteria
          courtyard <span class="characters">THULILE:</span> The Mensa.
          <span class="characters">CARLOS:</span> Yeah… that. Bye. (they leave)
        </p>
        <p class="scene four">
          <span class="scenes"><br />SCENE 4<br /></span>
          (There are students in the assembly room and people are talking and
          mumbling.)
          <span class="characters"><br />TEACHER:</span> Everyone, (claps his
          hands)… attention!
          <span class="characters"><br />STUDENT 1:</span> Shhhhh! Slowly the
          noise is clearing up and the students are getting still.
          <span class="characters"><br />TEACHER:</span> Great to have you back
          second years, to the first years: welcome to Robert Bosch College.
          Now, the Rector. (Students clap their hands as the Rector takes the
          stage) <span class="characters"><br />RECTOR:</span> Welcome you all,
          I am the Rector (pause and students laugh). Well, welcome to a
          journey. You all are important and have been elected not to all be the
          best in politics, music, dance, art and in the classroom. Each and
          every one will find their place in this school and hopefully at the
          end of the school year, you will all be better versions of yourselves.
          It is time to experiment, but not too much, to laugh and love but also
          not too much… I love to say this one thing : “Get out of your comfort
          zone, that is where life is.” Just know this journey will be up and
          down but do not let it divert you from your course. Thank you, … and
          now… <span class="characters"><br />THULILE:</span> (hears the Rector
          in the background)
          <span class="characters"><br />ZADA:</span> Thulile, Thulile? Are you
          okay? I just saw you zone off.
        </p>
        <p class="breaks">
          <span class="break">BREAK 2</span>
          Still in the auditorium, CARLOS and his friends are making jokes. They
          are waiting for the sex speech
          <span class="characters"><br />SY1:</span> Really? He is going to talk
          about sex…? <span class="characters"><br />RECTOR:</span> make sure
          you ask for consent
          <span class="characters"><br />SECOND YEAR (SY1) 1:</span> … he is
          about to say it… <span class="characters">RECTOR:</span> … I would not
          advise you to do it… <span class="characters"><br />SY1:</span> (says
          it together with Rector) use the condoms in the first floor… They all
          laugh <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> Does he always say
          that?
        </p>
        <p class="scene five">
          <span class="scenes"><br />SCENE 5</span>
          <span class="characters"><br />AMELIA:</span> If you would just move
          over I would be able to work in peace and get this done. Yes you, I am
          talking to you. Could you please…? (angrily)
          <span class="characters"><br />MARTIN:</span> I am sorry. But we are a
          team and we are supposed to work together.
          <span class="characters"><br />ZADA:</span> Yes
          <span class="characters"><br />AMELIA:</span> I am allowed to choose
          what I want to do. And I want to do this by myself.
          <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> What’s up? What are you
          guys arguing about?
          <span class="characters"><br />AMELIA:</span> Nothing (dismisses him)
          <span class="characters"><br />MARTIN:</span> Amelia apparently does
          not want to work with us..
          <span class="characters"><br />ZADA:</span> Yes
          <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> We wont finish if we
          continue playing these games. Let’s just work together. What are we
          going to lose? To make it easier… ummh.. Amelia could you please rake
          in the grass that side then Zada could you please pick the grass with
          the spade. Martin, you can push the load to that compost pile opposite
          the pizza oven. We can take turns but for now I can do the cutting. Is
          it okay? <span class="characters"><br />MARTIN:</span> Yeah sure
          <span class="characters"><br />ZADA:</span> Yes.
          <span class="characters"><br />AMELIA:</span> So you are just going to
          instruct us like that?
          <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> This will help us finish
          the job. <span class="characters"><br />AMELIA:</span> (Sighs)
          <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> At this point there is
          nothing I can do and say. They work for a while and Carlos starts
          talking <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> Excuse me guys,
          I need to quickly go to the restroom.
        </p>
        <p class="breaks">
          <span class="break"><br />BREAK 3<br /></span>
          (On his way to the restroom he meets Thulile)
          <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> Oh hey again. Are you
          guys learning already? I do not think I can take that.
          <span class="characters"><br />THULILE:</span> Hi. No. We are not
          learning yet but I need to finish my EE.
          <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> Okay, in my country we
          have like a solid month before we start learning. (awkward pause)I am
          joking, ha-ha (awkward laugh). But we have like a week.
          <span class="characters"><br />THULILE:</span> Okay.(shows that it is
          awkward - sigh)I was going to the ladies’ room, so please excuse me…
          <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> Me too! Oh…I mean… to
          the other room… the men’s room
          <span class="characters"><br />THULILE:</span> (Chuckles and closes
          door) <span class="characters"><br />CARLOS:</span> Bye… (take deep
          breath)
        </p>
        <p class="scene six">
          <span class="scenes"><br />SCENE 6<br /></span>
          (It is afterschool and Max is talking to his friends.)
          <span class="characters"><br />MAX:</span> It is going to be a blast;
          I did my calculations right and nothing can stop us now.
          <span class="characters"><br />SAMKELISO:</span> What are we supposed
          to do? <span class="characters"><br />MAX:</span> Yo! (angrily)I
          thought I gave each one of you guys a task. I do not want anyone
          ruining anything. This is supposed to happen. You all understand.
          <span class="characters"><br />ALL:</span> Yeah man.
          <span class="characters"><br />MAX:</span> Sammy, you are supposed to
          organize the hydrants – if you get me lad. Make sure you are not seen.
          Remember the brand?
          <span class="characters"><br />SAMKELISO:</span> Yeah man.
          <span class="characters"><br />JUSTIN:</span> Hey Max, who are we
          inviting to the party? <span class="characters"><br />MAX:</span> All
          those invited already got their invite. No need to worry.
          <span class="characters"><br />JUSTIN:</span> Did you invite Naseema
          though? <span class="characters"><br />MAX:</span> Hold it right
          there, you do not want to get me mad mate.
          <span class="characters"><br />JUSTIN:</span> What happened between
          you and her? <span class="characters"><br />MAX:</span> Bro? Shut the
          fuck up! Do not make me mad.
          <span class="characters"><br />MARVIN:</span> Stop it you two.
          <span class="characters"><br />PRINCE:</span> Yeah
        </p>
        <p class="scene seven">
          <span class="scenes"><br />SCENE 7</span>
          <span class="characters"><br />MARTIN:</span> What in the world was
          wrong with you today? I just do not get that a person can have
          shoelaces ruin their day. That is just ridiculous.
          <span class="characters"><br />GUS:</span> you wouldn’t understand,
          your naivety is far great bro. I am just not good
          <span class="characters"><br />MARTIN:</span> Thing is you have judged
          yours truly without even exposing him to the challenge. What’s up?
          <span class="characters"><br />GUS:</span> It’s home man. My parents
          are not in a good state. My sister called me yesterday telling me that
          my father sleeps on the couch in the living room. I really do not want
          them to grow apart – they looked happy. I mean they kinda… looked
          happy. I mean… everything …every relationship goes other… through
          challenges – fights or something. No?
          <span class="characters"><br />MARTIN:</span> Oh man, I am sorry to
          hear that. Have you talked to the peer supporters? I do not think they
          will grow apart, even if they do… they still love you and they will
          take care of you. <span class="characters"><br />GUS:</span> How do
          you know that? <span class="characters">MARTIN:</span> I am sure bro,
          relax. But you need to talk to the peer supporters or the school
          psychologist, you know. (on a positive note) Right now we can actually
          watch the new released movies – the avengers (shouts)… Yeah!
          <span class="characters"><br />GUS:</span> (less intrigued) sure, why
          not? <span class="characters"><br />MARTIN:</span> Loosen up man…
          (knock on the door)
          <span class="characters"><br />AMELIA:</span> Martin, hi Gus, I need
          to talk to you… In private, GUS and
          <span class="characters"><br />MARTIN:</span> Hi…
          <span class="characters"><br />MARTIN:</span> Okay, I am coming… (she
          exits)…(he whispers) I forgot to tell you… (he also exits the room)
          (in the hallway)[a bit more echo]
          <span class="characters"><br />MARTIN:</span> Yeah what’s up?
          <span class="characters"><br />AMELIA:</span> You might be in trouble…
          What you did during the lunch period…
          <span class="characters"><br />MARTIN:</span> I didn’t mean to… it was
          a mistake… <span class="characters"><br />AMELIA:</span> All I can
          say, be ready for tomorrow. Night. (leaves)
