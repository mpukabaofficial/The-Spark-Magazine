                    What is a right? It is a moral or legal entitlement to have or obtain something or to act in a certain way. What are equal human rights? It is the idea that everyone has the same rights and deserves the same level of respect. This means that laws, policies and programs should not be discriminatory and also those public authorities should not apply or enforce laws, policies and programs in a discriminatory way. The issue on rights is a national emergency that has been addressed for many generations before us. This article is based on a survey conducted by asking both males and females on their views on Women's rights, as I believe it has come to the point where we allow people the platform to express their views.

                  <p class="questionnaire">1.Where are women most likely to have their rights violated </p>
                  <p>The most common situation or setting where women rights are violated is in a romantic relationship. Relationships are supposed to be a safe space for both partners to grow mentally and emotionally through the support of the next partner but, in most instances, this is not the case.  women tend to find themselves cornered into doing things they are uncomfortable with, with the aim of trying to please their partner and in-laws if in a marriage. These kinds of violations may include women putting up with abuse like forced sex (rape), financial constraints, being beaten up, which is a case that we have been dealing with as a society for a long time. </p>

                    2.What is the root cause for women getting violated?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most people felt women are violated because of the entitlement man have over them. Society has shaped the way a man sees and treats a woman and they have been taught at a young stage that men are superior demanding authority. If some are deprived they tend to take it by force which leads to cases of Gender Based Violence. Women in poverty is one of the causes of their violation in the sense that women find themselves in situations where they tolerate violence because they get monetary benefits from it. Just recently social media was going wild over recent findings that some women allow man to use them as sex slaves in Dubai in order for them to make money and feed their families and have a proper lifestyle.

                    3.How Do We Address the Gender Gaps in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) And Executive Careers?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Women have taken matters in their own hands when it comes to addressing the inequalities in the STEM and executive careers. Women are getting degrees and PHDs in the fieldâ€™s society raised them to think they were not smart enough to take on. When one takes a closer look at the number of women over men in schools you would note that there are more educated women over men. Even though a point was raised that in most instances the qualifications that women hold is brushed off in certain companies because they still hold the stigma that women are not capable. A way we could address this issue is target the young generation and educate them on how women are just as capable as men in all fields of work especially in the sciences and executives. In the meantime, it was suggested that women should start building their own empires where they can recruit more women that way, they get the power they deserve.

                  <p class="questionnaire">4.Should Women Have Access to Non-Prescription Birth Control?</p>
                  <p>Over the counter birth controls were highly supported by both men and females on the view that morning after pills is easily accessible and they act as a birth control and other birth control should be just as accessible both pills and injections. Although there were some contradictions on this issue based on the side effects that come with the use of contraceptives some felt that condoms and basic abstinence should be the most advised forms of birth control to avoid cases where women bleed uncontrollably, severe headaches, weight gain/loss and skin problems to name a few. </p>
                    <p class="questionnaire">5.What Access Should Women Have to Abortion Clinics?</p>
                    <p>The issue of women having access to abortion clinics was tricky and most people were against allowing women to get abortions especially when it comes to consensual sexual intercourse. We all know that not all women fall pregnant as a result of sexual relations within a healthy relationship, some pregnancies are a result of rape. such a service should be provided for rape victims because their rights have been violated or people tend to have complications during pregnancies such as ectopic pregnancy which could be a health risk to the mother. It is advised that one should prevent using a condom and other contraceptives or something that is 100% effective which is simply abstaining. However, some felt Women should have full access to safe and well-regulated abortion clinics. Things don't always go according to plan, so they do deserve to make their own choices but after being advised first by a therapist and a health care personnel as an abortion can be just as traumatic as an unplanned pregnancy. </p>
                    <p class="questionnaire">6.How Do We Address the Current High Rates of Sexual Violence Toward Women?</p>
                    <p> At this point the only way to fight against this evil is to fight fire with more fire. Make rape sentences very harsh because rapists are comfortable with violating women as they know that they will get bail for E2000 (roughly $134) which is not a pinch at all. The laws of the country are without doubt required taking the matter women being violated as a sense of emergency, just early in the month of May UNESWA students have been sexually harassed in their room the early hours of the morning by an unknown suspect at knife point and it took the police 3 hours to reach the scene and till today the suspects have not been found. Imposing corrective action at school, workplace, communities, and homes. These include, demotion, expulsion, arresting the suspects, leaving toxic environments young men and women should be educated on this matter and victims should be provided with counselling and therapy sessions. Confidential channels that women can use to report such cases should be available as some are afraid to report their abusers for them to be comfortable enough to open up </p>

                    <p class="questionnaire">7. What Is Something That Has Been Overshadowed When It Comes to Women's Rights? </p>
                  <p>Women are not given the credit they deserve in workplaces, relationships and everyday life. Men take all the credit. Women's efforts are always overshadowed especially when they are working in an environment that is dominant by men. women's voices are not heard, they are dismissed most of the time and their side of the story is never heard. The fact that women own their bodies, and they have every right to do as they want and choose what is right for them. We need to start listening more and stop dictating on what they should and should not do especially when it come to their dress code. For some dress is a way of self expression and when society pushes women into a corner with rules on what to wear where when and why we are denying them freedom of expression which a basic human right. Rape in relationships, just because someone is your partner does not automatically give them consent, most women are raped by their lovers and all anyone can say is "How can he rape you, heâ€™s your boyfriend â€œAnother issue is that of drunken consent. there is no such thing, a drunk woman has no consent to give, you have sex with her, you raped her, especially if she doesn't even know you. </p>
                  <p>This survey on Women's rights Is a piece to bring to light what people think on the subject matter. It is a piece aimed at raising a debate within oneself and actually thinking about if the way women are treated in society is a way one should be living?</p>
