                    "You are what you think", I'm sure we've all heard that quite a number of times in our lives and despite our reluctance to actually believe it, it's a phrase that most often than not proves to be true. The most successful people, as proven by numerous studies, thought of themselves and saw themselves as achievers and they pursued their dream and got to it. And another sad reality is that those that believe they're not good enough for anything and they'll amount to nothing, if their perspective never changes they actually do become a sorry sight. The part though that most of us struggle to understand is we can't renew our minds and think differently except through the intervention of a divine being. No matter how much encouraging books and quotes we read, it doesn't really change perspective when we're just doing it by ourselves. So we've hurt ourselves and have been our biggest crushers of dreams simply by our thinking and or attitude. 
                   </p>

                   <div class="quotes">
                    <p class="quotes-words">
                      "And another sad reality is that those that believe they're not good enough for anything and they'll amount to nothing, if their perspective never changes they actually do become a sorry sight."
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  

                   <p>Now that I've touched on attitude I'll jot a brief description of what it is from the English dictionary. 'Attitude is a complex mental state involving beliefs and feelings and values and dispositions to act in certain ways.' This means that how we act, how we live, how we behave is tied to our mental states, that is, how we think. We cannot rise above what we think of ourselves. You think you are a winner and achiever, then you eventually become a winner and an achiever. You think about it then act towards it and it manifests. You think you're a loser and will never amount to anything in life then you start behaving like a loser and really amount to nothing. You think you're ugly and nobody likes you and you live a gloomy life that's all shades of gray and nobody wants to associate with you, because it's draining and they just can't deal with you cause wow, everyone has enough problems of their own really. You think you'll never get somewhere and you never do. There's plenty more examples. But my point is our mental frame is important and most often than not we do need divine intervention. </p>
                  
                   <div class="quotes">
                    <p class="quotes-words">
                      "This means that how we act, how we live, how we behave is tied to our mental states, that is, how we think."
                    </p>
                  </div>

                   <p>Good news! There is divine intervention. The new living translation states "don't copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think." How amazing! There's always solutions to this life thing trust me. So, what we learn is the availability of a solution to the way we think. In order for us to think differently and positively and in sync with our dreams then the wisest thing to do would be to allow for a transformation of the mind. It changes everything to be transformed to a new person. It makes one unstoppable. It makes life bearable. It makes dreams achievable. It makes one not to even feel pressured and burdened by the behaviors and customs of this world. In renewal of the mind, the glass is always seen as half full instead of half empty. There is always possibilities despite the set systems of the world. </p>
                   
                  <div class="hero-articles">
                    <img src="/images/Dreams 2.jpg" alt="" class="hero-articles--background" />
                  </div>
                  

                  <p>
                    There's one thing that comes with renewal though. A choice to actually allow yourself to be renewed, to have your attitude renewed. After all has been said and done, one needs to accept the renewal for it to work. It's an agreement you make, a conscious decision. It's a beautiful experience however to live in a positive mindset. Before us is set the choice to choose between life and death, and the one who set that so dearly wishes we choose life, in all aspects, even in the way we think. Death can transpire in so many ways if we remain with unrenewed minds. There's death of dreams. There's death of hope, of love, of joy, of peace, of happiness and even the most tragic one, physical death due to suicide. It all stems from what we think. What is in our minds. Physical death also due to stress and anxiety, one root, how we think. 
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    But the good news is we can always choose life. Choose hope. Choose love. Choose peace. Choose all the beautiful things that the world has to offer. That's life. Sounds fulfilling right? Well to me it does. So why not turn to the giver of life to transform you into a new person by renewing your mind and changing the way you think? We can only reach our full potential and dreams by actually allowing  our attitudes to be renewed and transformed. It's a free call.

                   <p>So, how is your mental state? What is in your mind? "Oh how I wish that yee choose life!"                                         </p>
