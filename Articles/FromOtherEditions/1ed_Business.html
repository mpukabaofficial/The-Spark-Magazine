        <h1 class="article-title">Business in eSwatini: A testimonial.</h1>
        <p class="article-date">Last edited: 7/18/2022</p>
        <p class="article-start">
            Mr Matsebula has shown great skill and competence in business and real estate. He has been able to successfully deal with property in eSwatini – which is not an easy task. His advice is valuable for upcoming Swazi entrepreneurs. 
        </p>

        <p class="article-start">
            Q: Using one word/or phrase and a given reason, how would you describe business in eSwatini?
        </p>
        <p>
            A: I find business in eSwatini to be interesting in a sense that it is challenging. With all these ups an down, it is rewarding at the same time. 
        </p>
       <p class="article-start">
        Q: What things (2 things) do you think has made your business successful in eSwatini
       </p>

       <div class="quote dark quote-color-charcoal">
        <p>
          "Persistence"
        </p>
      </div>

       <p>
        A: Persistence is key, you have to continue long enough no matter the struggles. Diligence has also made my business flourish, taking time to pay attention to detail has ensured that at the end I was a winner.
       </p>
       <p class="article-start">
        Q: What have been your setbacks in your business in eSwatini?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Lack of right education or mentorship. That's one biggest setback actually in the business world no matter the location. Not being knowledgeable enough about your business leaves you vulnerable and prone to failure or rather stagnation and unproductivity. 
      </p>

      <p class="article-start">
        Q: What is your advice to the youth or aspiring business people?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: I would advice the youth to educate themselves about the business world and the business they would like to venture in. Ignorance contributes in the failure of a business. Secondly, get mentorship! Kutsiwa ngesiSwati indlela ibutwa kulabasembili. 
    
       <br>
       <br> Ask for advice and insight from people who have gone through the journey you are embarking on. This does not mean it will all be smooth. Don't be afraid to fail or fall. If you come across failure, just take it as a lesson and keep going, keep pushing. You will get better with time. Real failure is giving up! 
      </p>
      <p class="article-start">
        Q:  What have been your main motivations (at least 2) to continue in business during hard times?
      </p>
      <p>
        <ol>
            <li>My dreams! I have always had big dreams and they used to scare me, they still do but I just knew I had to accomplish at least some of them. </li>
            <li>My faith has kept me going. I have always trusted in the good plans that God has for me, so no matter how hard and impossible attaining these big goals might seem at first glance, I always keep my trust in Him and his promises, for they are Yes and Amen!</li>
            <li>
            My family. When life hits you hard out there, you are blessed when you have a family that loves and supports you. And most importantly in this case; believes in your dreams. It always completes the hustle
            </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <div class="quote dark intro-red">
        <p>
          "Diligence"
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="article-start">
        Q: I have heard your sermon on the four (if I am not mistaken) things that can help us create wealth, could you please outline these key points – without going into great depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Tithe, the 10% of your income is not yours but God's, therefore it is important to offer tithes. As a born again Christian I have been faithful to this. I believe it has made all the difference.</li>
            <li>Save at least 10% of your income (preferable 20%), this will create a very bright financial future for you.</li>
            <li>Work hard. Diligence will set you apart, as well as yield out great results.</li>
            <li>Invest, many people fail to invest because they have poor  saving skills. Investing enables you to get huge amounts of returns in the long run which will greatly and positively impact your life as well as your business. One could even venture into many business opportunities with this money. These investments include buying income generating properties, you don't need to have all the money in the whole world, the bank could be one avenue that could help you in terms of lending you cash to do starts ups or cover up costs here and there.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p class="article-start">
        Q: Most people are asked this question: with the knowledge you have now, if you were twenty years old, what 4 things would you have done differently.
      </p>
      <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Save at least 20% of your income, no matter the amount of the income I earned</li>
            <li>Start family early, latest at 30 years.</li>
            <li>Put up an advisory team that would guide me in taking the right steps and choices towards achieving my goals.</li>
            <li>Get the right education, especially financial educati</li>
        </ol>

      <p class="article-start">
        Q: What new avenues do you think will be successful in eSwatini that the youth should look out for?
      </p>
      <p>
        A:  Real estate, with the right background information/education, you just can't go wrong! 
      </p>
      <p class="article-start">
        Q: Any other encouragement to the youth in business, investment or finance?
      </p>
      <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Dream, and dream big! The sky is NO limit, you can achieve your dreams no matter how big and scary they might seem.</li>
            <li>The education all around the globe pays no attention to financial education but in order to gain money and to achieve financial freedom you need to educate yourself. Rich people have written a lot of book on this so you need to read, read, read. That’s just about it. The books I suggest you should start reading are: How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie, Rich Dad poor dad by Robert Kiyosaki, The Magic of Thinking Big by David Swartz, The Parable of Dollar by Sam Adeyemi, Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, How to sell yourself by Ray Grose, The Richest Man in Babylon by George Clawson, You are Accepted by Heaven is A Gift.  </li>
            <li>Last but very important, Get right with God. As a Christian I get my motivation from God because I have a personal relationship with Him and I know you will always find your worth and greatest motivation in God, if you get right with Him.</li>
        </ol>
