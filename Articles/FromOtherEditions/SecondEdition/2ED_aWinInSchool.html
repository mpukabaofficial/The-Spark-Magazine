        I don’t know about everyone, but education is constantly getting
        frustrating and unpleasant with time. I do not know if it is because I
        have been doing this for over a decade but there is something about it.
        “Why should we spend the peak of our lives in a routine that teaches us
        things that we will not need in the future?” <br />
        “When am I going to use integration when I buy milk in the store?”
        <br />
        “How do tectonic plates feed me when I am hungry?”<br />
        “For goodness sake why do I need to wake up early to just learn
        physics?” <br />
        If this for getting a good job, why do we have to learn so much? People
        aren’t happy with their jobs and the job market is looking grim, what if
        all this is for nothing? School is frustrating for most people, it is
        boring for many and ultimately useless for the unemployed in the
        country. So why bother? It took a decade for amazon to be the billion
        dollar company it is now, some people hardly scratch around E200 000 (14
        000 US$) annually yet they have been to school for over two decades. It
        is discouraging, to some, very unfair.

        First of all, I think has been corrupted by the association of education
        and our survival. To oppose myself early: rightfully so, if survival
        without education was easy and/or by default possible, then people would
        not be incentivised to learn, slowly brewing a people of total
        ignorance. However, the there is joy in education that, unfortunately,
        we might not be able to appreciate in our lifetime. One of the issues of
        education it is wrapped around expensive and ridiculous tuitions fees,
        books and for some, uniforms. It also creates a certain expectations by
        the payer to the scholar. It results in tensions and conflict when the
        student is not doing so well. Consequently, this makes education a high
        stakes experience for academics.

        Education is a key factor in reducing global poverty, according to the
        United Nations. Although wealth disparity exists, poverty has
        significantly decreased over the past 50 years. The argument that some
        billionaires because they did not complete formal education they are
        successful, is very misleading. First, that is not the point! The point
        of education is not success but it is like training a soldier for war
        and as graphic as that sounds, the idea is that people can become better
        citizens and potentially contribute into the longevity of our species
        and its pursuit of the truth. Also, learning is something our brain
        enjoys doing. It is no wonder we have so many theories about how things
        work as we try to navigate the world. Education is an instrument for
        understanding our world and it happens to be also a path to our
        respective success, whatever success means for each one of us.

        /></a>
      </div>

      <p>
        Acting naïve isn’t a solution because education is a path to getting a
        job a making a living. If one does not invest their time in school and
        aim to get good grades they are unlikely to foster a successful career.
        Some people are able to make it through, because of their innovation,
        luck, and hard work without having to complete the full course of the
        journey of school, but that is a significant minority of people.
        Contrary to that, if you think you are special and will get out of
        poverty without school – go right ahead – but if you are being realistic
        and have not shown capabilities that have been rewarded by money and
        status, probably you ought to go to school because it increases your
        chances considerably. Knowing our country, eSwatini, this could never
        have been truer.
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, the value of education, while debated due to its flaws
        and financial burdens, is undeniably fundamental for personal growth and
        societal progress. While some succeed without formal education, these
        are exceptions rather than the rule. For most, education broadens
        opportunities and enhances life prospects. In eSwatini, education is
        vital for both individual success and national development, equipping
        citizens to tackle local and global challenges. It's not just a win for
        students, schools and the country, but a triumph for humanity.
