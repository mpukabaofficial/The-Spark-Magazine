          “Discipline is choosing between what you want now, and what you want
          the most.” <br />
          ~Abraham Lincoln
        </p>
      </div>
      <p class="article-start">
        Discipline is a word that is disappearing daily in the dialogue of
        today’s youth. I am watching our microwave generation failing to sustain
        anything they start. This is not the belt-beating-buttock type of
        discipline (referred to as punishment) but the discipline of training
        ones self to consistency in anything precisely self-discipline.
        Discipline is continuous and habitual, it is a way of life, a principle
        you live by to attain a specific result. It is my belief that we should
        learn self-discipline from our predecessors because, truth be told, the
        amount of discipline my grandparents had I could never compete with.
        This is not because of their experience but because of the acts of
        discipline they still carry out until this day. In most households truly
        you have made it if you manage to wake up consistently before your
        grandmother or grandfather you have made it in life. It would be an
        error on our part to overlook this because there lays the keys to
        accomplishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you not wonder how some of our parents and grandparents who did not
        go to school are holding seats in corporate settings. Their discipline
        ensured the mastery of their skills such that a university degrees that
        cannot be able to teach. Start now! If you think you will be able to
        sustain that business idea or venture in the future out of sheer will
        you must be boo-boo the fool. People who are able to keep things are
        those who understand perseverance and patience. If success was simply a
        matter of getting a formal education, we would all be eating its fruits.
        The people who are seated at the top are making money and taking
        decisions over your life while you sleep or while you keep postponing
        that assignment.

        Self-discipline starts with making your bed right after you wake up, it
        starts with doing your homework on time and consistently, it starts with
        finally waking up in the morning to jog and keep on doing it even when
        it is not too convenient. Self-discipline starts with choosing to finish
        anything you start, it starts with overcoming all your excuses. If you
        do not start it not, it will be a struggle later. Honestly, I do not
        even have the time to be writing these articles, but I used to be that
        kid who always did their homework, no matter what. I am now
        uncomfortable not handing in anything I promised to do – discipline. Why
        bother? Well mainly because your success is your own responsibility. It
        takes one to push themselves past what they believed their limit to be
        and standout in the midst of their generation
      </p>

      <p>
        Discipline is also associated with perseverance. Show me any person who
        holds their success but are without perseverance and I will show you a
        man who it is only a matter of time before they loose it. The ability to
        push towards your dreams despite excuses that have been rationalized by
        your mind is a fruit of discipline. Self-discipline teaches you how to
        value your dreams and goals. It takes time, effort, pain and effort to
        develop certain positive habits. When I started jogging, I went through
        muscle pain, joint pain, back pain, body pain, you name it. The stamina
        I have now has enabled other areas of dietary consciousness that keep me
        going. I keep at it because I know the price to pay to start again. The
        ability to keep getting up each time you fail and each time you are
        rejected comes from resilience. It takes an extra ordinary ability also
        called a ‘fighting spirit’. Our society is full of people who have a
        negative outlook on life, it will take you developing a mindset and
        sticking to it to be any different.
