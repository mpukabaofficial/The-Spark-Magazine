        The government of Eswatini has to cut off its monopolistic hand over the
        mining sector if it wants the economy to sky-rocket!
      </h1>

      <p class="article-start">
        Against the backdrop of 70% of the population living below the poverty
        line and unemployment so rife, it is quite disappointing how the
        government still insists on having a huge medley of monopoly in the
        minerals and mining industry. The country has huge potential of being a
        lucrative mining powerhouse if only the government could consider
        detaching its huge domination over the minerals market. Foreign Direct
        Investment could go on an upward trajectory if only the government eased
        the 50% control of the mining terrain of the country.
      </p>
      <h4>LEGISLATION ALLOWS GOVERNMENT MONOPOLY IN THE SECTOR</h4>
      <p>
        Home to the oldest known and operational mine in the world, the lovely
        country of ours is astonishingly lagging behind in terms of growth and
        development of the minerals resources sector. The main reason for the
        sluggish mining sector is the deliberate monopoly that the government
        has over the sector through legal instrumentations including the Mines
        and Minerals Act of 2011. This piece of legislation gives the state and
        its head the lucratively rewarding courtesy of having 50% direct control
        of every mine in the county. Section 133 of the statute stipulates that
        “ (1) The Ingwenyama in trust for the Eswatini Nation shall acquire 25
        per cent shareholding without any monetary consideration in a
        large-scale mining project for which a mining licence is granted.” The
        other 25% that the act makes provisions to is for the state, leaving the
        company that is granted a mining license in the country only left with
        50% shareholding. This statute makes the illusion that the King is
        holding the 25% shareholding in benefit to the ordinary LiSwati, which
        in all its shades is untrue and an unlived reality! What is an
        unquestionable fact is that the ordinary Swati citizen does not have
        leeway to any benefits of profits in the mining sector as section 133(1)
        of the main mining legislative piece claims. 70% of the population
        continues to languish in dire poverty while the government smiles all
        the way to the bank in gross profits.

      <h4>THE HISTORY OF MINING COMPANIES FLEEING</h4>
      <p>
        Salgaocar Mine PTY (LTD) was a beaming lighthouse of hope and employment
        for many Ngwenya Residents. The iron ore mining institution was
        unarguably the biggest mine in the country which made the biggest
        revenue returns in the local mining market. Themba Msibi, who was one of
        the heavy equipment operator in the mine now owned by Mwelase Mining
        Eswatini recalls how the closure and seizing of operations by SALGAOCAR
        in 2014 affected him and his family. “I had 2 children whom I supported
        in tertiary when the sudden news that the mine was going to close
        broke”. The infamous closure of the mine rendered Msibi along with a
        multitude of his former colleagues unemployed and without any manners of
        making ends meets. The government’s 50% rule in the mining industry is
        one of the reasons that can be attributed as the leading factors that
        steered the closure of the mine. Unemployment is disastrous for an
        economy of any country. If the sector operated in a free-market, job
        creation would in surplus, investors would come flocking in and the GDP
        would shoot in an appealing up. The government’s “bully-big brother” in
        the sector is one of the reasons why the sector will not grow and revive
        the economy. So in other words, the government is delaying grand
        employment and mass fiscal development by furthering its monopolistic
        dogma in the industry.
      </p>

      <p>
        The number of mining companies making an exit due to the 50%
        monopoly-driven prerequisite is pure testament to the level of
        dissatisfaction Foreign Investors have with the government’s policy when
        it comes to minerals control and mine ownership. Just the other day,
        Prince Lonkhokhela, the new Minister of Mineral Resources made a grand
        announcement of a recent discovery of gold deposits in the country. Who
        will own the means of production? The state! The very state that claims
        to have our best interests at heart will own the means of production of
        the new gold mine, me and you will continue to be audiences on the
        sidelines while the government continues to make tonnes of profits while
        claiming to hold the minerals in our trust as the Minerals Act claim.

      <p>
        The Country can undergo an exodus of industrial development and economic
        resuscitation if only the government can reevaluate its policy stance on
        the minerals industry. The sector has huge potential of being the
        leading contributor to the economy. For how long are we going to depend
        on sugar solely?? It’s the 21st century and our economy is still based
        on the resilience of the sugar industry. Its time for an industrial
        change. Mining has the ability of changing our economic misfortunes as a
        country. We cannot continue being a country whose economy rests on the
        tiny granules of sugar! Working closely with the new Ministry of
        Justice, the government has to setup a parliamentary portfolio committee
        that will look into ways of transforming the minerals sector in the
        country. One way is to do away with legislative statutes and clauses
        that permits this lethal governmental monopoly. Develop legal frameworks
        that will enable a free minerals market without the influence of
        government control. Look at Botswana!! That country is ten years ahead
        of us already in terms of development because one of its key economic
        contributors is the diamond and the government’s limited influence and
        monopoly in the natural resources’ fraternity. The current Minerals
        Council also has to be dismantled and a new minerals board appointed. We
        cannot carry on having individuals who do not represent our interests as
        the masses having a sit in the council. All these things will awaken the
        economy to greater heights.
