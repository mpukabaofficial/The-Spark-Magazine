            The Spark has evolved a great deal over the previous editions;
             yet my belief in our mission is firm and has never been 
             stronger. The magazine may not make sense today, but for 
             the future of eSwatini, it is an essential blueprint. 
             Let’s recap; to stay on course we need to be constantly
              reminding ourselves the purpose of this magazine. This 
              magazine aims to answer two fundamental questions: what 
              is there to like about eSwatini? And how can we work 
              together to transform eSwatini? Nonetheless, the changes 
              we need will come to fruition. Looking back at how far we, 
              The Spark, have come; we are amazed at amount of support we have gotten; the ideas we have gathered and the work we have put in. This magazine is sowing thoughts that otherwise would have not been for at least decades to come. As we continue experimenting with ways to raise awareness about this magazine; there is still hope for us to be the future: together.

            Looking back, we have faced various obstacles; and a lingering flaw was the need to be everything to everyone. What does this mean? It means the main objectives of the magazine became trivial as we attempted to accommodate non-readers. There was never a need to include upcoming events nor a need to include flashy features on our website. We were attempting to attract and become relevant to anyone and everyone. After realizing our oversight, we had to prioritize our mission again, with renewed energy and better focus.

            Simplicity, often, can be the best bet when one wants to attain something of value in life. As such, simplifying our objectives has significantly helped intensify our focus. In my opinion, achievers prioritize important tasks and cut out the world around them in order to focus. Steve jobs said, “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully.” The concept of simplicity can be applied to other aspects of our being – our minds, our bodies, and our actions. Simplicity also connects deeply with the notion of sacrifice, both of which are difficult to practice. What ties them both together is discipline because, when simplifying, one needs to be disciplined and confident enough to sacrifice other seemingly important tasks.

            In my opinion, our days are becoming overwhelmed with unrelated and jumbled up activities causing people to thoroughly believe that their busy. We have adapted to this situation so much; it will take courage to let go of some pointless activities – simplifying our lives. You are right if you think that if one becomes focussed on fewer things, the are going to be above average. So, not joining all those clubs and saying no to that invite is part of the journey. Simplicity is an art. The art behind simplicity is that a person needs to be aware of their actions, decision and articulations and use the awareness to express ultimate focus. A famous chef, Graham Elliot said that at the highest level of cooking, the aim is to cut down as many components or elements in the dish as possible to achieve a state where all the components in the dish play a significant role.

            Our aim for this edition is to perpetually persuade readers to adopt a mindset of simplicity, focus and discipline because we believe that it is necessary. Welcome to the fifth edition in which we explore the topic of simplicity!
