        Nomvuyo Dlamini: The Precious Gift That Keeps on Giving
      </h1>

      <p class="article-start">
        Rupturing peripheries seems to be her life mantra. A visionary who has
        asserted her place amongst young people crafting their way to the
        pinnacle of success in the country. Businesswoman, CEO and corporate
        extraordinaire in the making. Going behind the archetype and fundamental
        ideologies of Nomvuyo Phetsile Precious Dlamini was a task I was so
        soaked up and ready for.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s another incomprehensible weather day in Manzini, a few rays of
        sunshine when you least expect them, next minute it immediately covers
        up with masses of clouds when you’re just enjoying the sunshine. I
        happen to be 20 minutes late for my interview with this maverick and in
        her true professional virtue; she’s fashionably 30 minutes early. First
        thing that leaves me in absolute awe with her is her distinct
        professionalism and her unapologetic respect for time and her
        punctuality. My late arrival and a few technical issues, much to her
        revulsion, throw her off the rails. Like the professional she is, she
        immediately gets grumpy. While we wait for our technical issues to be
        resolved, we decide to take a hopeless walk around the city. Like the
        ‘gentleman’ I am, I offer to carry her heavy-loaded bag while we walk
        but I’m told “don’t worry, I’m a big girl”. She immediately gets
        unshackled, all smiles and oh boy! She can definitely talk!! She takes
        me to parts of Manzini I am not acquainted with while offering me
        insightful conversations and a sneak-peak into her life. While still on
        our two feet voyage around Manzini, we happen to bump into her chief
        business competitor. Like old lovers they are instantly up in each
        other’s arms with such genuine adoration for each other. “You know,
        they’ve tried pitting us against each other”, she tells me. Though as
        competing industry leaders in the gifting service sector in the country,
        the two visibly have nothing but absolute love and respect for each
        other. After our preamble walk and a few window shopping trips, we
        finally get to settle down and our in-depth conversation begins with a
        few tear drop moments in between.

      <h4>THE NOMVUYO STORY</h4>
      <p>
        Bred in Mhlambanyathi and later Mantabeni,the Siphocosini homegirl has
        always been a tester of new things from her earliest of years. The
        Usuthu Primary and KaBoyce high school alumnus has always been one not
        to shy away from any challenge since her bud years. She literally has
        played every sport in the almanac; from long shot, to swimming, to
        volleyball to cricket. “I once tried out basketball once in highschool
        and it didn’t work out”, she teases. Nomvuyo attributes her upbringing
        to the incomparable woman she is today. Her parents have played a
        peerless role in shaping the person she is today. With faith and the
        unchanging word of God being two of the arch principles Dlamini’s
        parents instilled in her from a young age. In an ever apologetic world,
        Dlamini remains steadfast and unwavering in her spirituality and
        accredits her love for God as a provocation for all her virtues. The
        Dlamini household surely did prepare Nomvuyo for the world and what was
        to come along the way. “My parents planted a fighting spirit in me”, she
        with such a wide smile on her beautiful face reminisces. Being the last
        born didn’t deter her parents from teaching her that she won’t always
        get what she wants and that failure and rejection, if responded to
        correctly, can be building blocks for a solid foundation. The life
        lessons inculcated to her in her household were definitely a beautiful
        prelude to the birth of her baby, a powerhouse in the making; Precious
        Treats.

      <h4>PRECIOUS TREATS</h4>

      <p>
        Conceptualized in 2021 in the acme of the many stages of the COVID 19
        pandemic, Dlamini saw a colossal gap in the market after she herself
        faced a pickle predicament on the afore of mother’s day. She was looking
        to bequest her mother with sentimental items in one gift pack. Browsing
        through the web one day, she stumbled upon the gifting service model and
        she immediately knew she wanted to do that for Mrs Dlamini. “I had zero
        resources, I was broke and I had no material, the only thing I had was a
        box of cornflakes”, Nomvuyo ruminates of her first ever Precious Treat.
        She set out to decorate the cornflakes box and splurged a few chocolates
        inside and that was Mrs Dlamini’s mother’s day gift from her last born
        that year with which she absolutely loved! That is when Nomvuyo knew
        that this had to be a mercenary venture. With zero to nothing start-up
        capital she had her work cut out for her. What was intellectualised in a
        moment of appreciation for her mother grew to become what is undoubtedly
        the go-to gifting service business in the country. With her own
        university student personal allowance, Dlamini was able to oil the
        wheels of her venture from a mere vision to an actual business. As a
        blossoming grassroots SME owner who is still on her way to prominence,
        Nomvuyo advises entrant small businesses against seeking loans without
        any solid fiscal start-up generation plan. Her paradigm is that entrant
        level business owners should first work on developing their own
        entrepreneurial identity before resorting to external start-up funding.
        “Fight for you to have your own start-up, do a deep background search
        before going out there and seeking a loan, and it is okay to start
        small. Sell those fatcakes, do whatever it takes for you to formulate an
        individual start-up for your business”, she abets. While profit is the
        sole purpose of any business venture, the Precious Treat executive
        broaches that the peaks of owning a business are not only constrained to
        mercenary and monetary horizons only. She attributes the incomparable
        sacrifices that business owners have to bear on a daily basis as one of
        the worthwhile reputes of being an SME captain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her business model is quite enthralling. She capitalizes and makes money
        out of something she herself is an admitted fan of; LOVE! And affection.
        As an all-time aficionado of love, Nomvuyo says she derives her biggest
        satisfaction from seeing the reaction on her client’s face whenever she
        delivers another bespoke Precious Treat. While still a small scale
        business on base level, Precious Treats has been a pioneer in the
        gifting service sector in the country. As an entrepreneur who is also an
        off-the-hook creative at heart and always pushing the periphery, Dlamini
        is not one to shy away from a business opportunity. Her business has
        tapped into the corporate realm as well. In February this year, Precious
        Treats joined forces with the Eswatini Tourism Group for a Valentine’s
        Day giveaway like no other. The move, aided by the group’s objective of
        promoting domestic tourism in the country saw Precious Treats being one
        of the crucial partners for the group’s valentine day’s promotion.
        Dlamini has stories for days to tell about the countless rejections
        she’s ever had to face as an SME owner. Instead of floundering in any
        collieries of the entrepreneurial rejection she has ever had to face,
        Nomvuyo uses any rejection she faces as an opportunity to do
        entrepreneurial self-introspection. Her partnership with Eswatini
        Tourism this year is one of the evident results of her unwavering
        tenacity to craft opportunities to broaden her horizons as an
        entrepreneur. Nomvuyo’s future plans for Precious Treats are
        unfathomable. While relentlessly striving to perfect and assert herself
        as a fully established entrepreneur, she has enormous plans for her
        business. Being a powerplayer in the Sub Saharan region and Southern
        hemisphere of the continent is one the long-term ambitions Nomvuyo has
        of her venture.

      <h4>ENACTUS</h4>

      <p>
        Established in 1975 by renowned attorney Robert T. Davis, initially
        called the Students In Free Action(SIFE) . Enactus is a social
        entrepreneurship project, globally renowned for working with young
        thinkers, using business and innovation as two apparatus for solving
        social issues faced by the masses on a daily basis. Setting its armour
        in the country in 2002 in Uneswa Kwaluseni, Enactus has been helping
        young leaders in the country to reinvigorate and sharpen their
        entrepreneurial and problem solving skills in over 15 institutions
        including campuses in the country for the past 2 decades. One of
        Nomvuyo’s greatest accomplishments is being the CEO of the coveted
        ENACTUS Luyengo Campus. Stepping in a two deacades legacy of such
        stature as Enactus holds as a captain of the Luyengo ship, Dlamini had
        her work cut out for her. Being CEO of such a big organisation at such a
        young age was not something she could ever predetermine. Nomvuyo was
        nominated and handpicked on a mass-scale majority vote by her peers to
        steer this enormous ship. A move that irked some of her colleagues
        within the ranks of ENACTUS. She reflects on the time some members
        stepped down from ENACTUS the moment she was announced the new CEO
        simply because they did not trust the leadership of such a young woman.
        Nomvuyo acknowledges the fact that as a person, it is impossible to get
        everyone to like you. She has been called fake by people who find her
        “too good to be true” and positivity and the deep knowledge of her true
        self is how Nomvuyo rises about any form of negativity she stumbles
        upon,along her journey as a wearer of multiple hats.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is an irrefutable fact that Nomvuyo’s term as CEO has garnered
        extraordinary rewards for the Enactus Luyengo Campus team. Under her
        impeccable leadership, the team won the National Enactus Competitions
        outperforming 14 fellow Enactus institution teams. A E20 000 cheque was
        one of the compliments that came with the National Championship
        accolade. The team was to represent the country at international level
        at the ENACTUS global competition in Puerto Rico, a trip which
        unfortunately didn’t see the light of day due to travel financing
        difficulties. Speaking of this monumental era that is undoubtedly one of
        the major groundbreaking achievements of the Enactus Luyengo Team in its
        entire existence, Dlamini attributes the dedication of her whole team as
        a main ingredient for their win. She states that her teammates make it
        so easy for her as a leader. A win that in Nomvuyo’s own words, came
        through a lot of sacrifice and a handful of sleepless nights for the
        team. The young leader is also beaming in pride as the Enactus Luyengo
        Team was selected as finalists in the Eswatini Communications Commission
        Innovation Challenge. At this point, there is no denying this young
        woman’s leadership prowess. One cannot begin to even fathom what the
        corporate future of this glowing young star looks like.
      </p>

      <p>
        A beautiful story worth documenting, Nomvuyo’s life story is clearly one
        that will not be an ordinary cliché. Her relentless spirit and her
        beautiful aura that instantly lights up the dimmest of rooms is a
        blatant indicator that this is a powerhouse in the making. In a 24 hour
        clock day, the maverick is able to balance school, as a Bachelor Of
        Education in Consumer Science undergraduate student, a thriving CEO and
        a business owner of an SME. She admits that the pressure does get to her
        at times and the road can be a bit winding. “I put so much pressure on
        myself, I have suffocated myself and I have lost myself a few times” she
        discloses. The beautiful starlet reveals that she currently is on a
        beautiful journey of self-rediscovery. She accredits her solid support
        structure consisting of her loving and supportive family and friends as
        one of the cushions keeping her alive and bustling.
      </p>

      <p>
        What’s more to say? The future undeniably looks blindingly bright for
        this young gem. And the pages and chapters in her success and failures
        book seem to be added in chunks everyday. And in her life-story, success
        seems to be the main protagonist. Nomvuyo’s Spark is one that will burn
        fiercely for quite a long time it seems, and this looks like just the
        beginning. And we at the Spark cannot wait to document every one of the
        monumental milestones she is yet to reach!
