        I grapple a little with the concept of authenticity, merely because we
        tend to abuse and misuse the term without having any fathoming of what
        this principle really means. Many of us have even had to expropriate
        this principle without even staying true to its D.N.A. Are you really
        authentic? In this ever fast-paced world of façades that often forces us
        to close the curtains on our true selves, how often do we betray our own
        authenticity? If you’d ask me that question, I’d ashamedly tell you I’ve
        contravened and affronted my own authentic state of being a lot more
        times than often. We suppress our true selves because society directly
        and obliviously conditions us to thrust aside who we really are and be
        in sequence with the doctrine of what a “normal” person should be like,
        in order to fit in. Ironically, the “misfits” and the rebels in society
        are the only calibre of people who are enlightened enough to live
        according to their own truth, being in perfect sync with the fundamental
        principle of authenticity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Authenticity is more than just a paradigm. It is a state of being! Many
        brands and people alike tend to claim to be authentic when they are
        merely just following a ubiquitous trend. Being authentic is not
        constituted by pervasiveness. The major construct of the principle is
        the fact that authentic people never follow trends simply because they
        ache to be accepted. Authentic people are nonconformists who blaze their
        own trails and carve their own trends without any correlation of what
        the world expects of them to do. The day we realise that inauthenticity
        hinders our success and overall happiness, our lives will surely change!
        The sovereignty of our own happiness rests in our own hands, and
        authenticity is probably the most underrated key to substantial
        happiness. There’s so much fullness at our own disposal if only we
        realized that living our lives according to our own truth and veracity
        unlocks an unmatched higher power of spiritual enlightenment. Yes,
        authenticity is a spiritual course! It speaks to spaces and reaches to
        places that normal mannered people can never touch base at. An elevated
        pitch of higher vibration frequencies is unravelled every time you
        decide to challenge the normative status quo and settle to DO YOU
        authentically in all of your glory, unapologetically so! I implore you
        right now to let yourself loose of the clutches of pretentiousness
        standing in your way of experiencing this spiritual orgasm of being your
        own true authentic self.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being inauthentic has grinding and devastating clouts on our mental
        health and overall psychological state of being. A research conducted by
        the health sciences department of the University of Essex a couple of
        years back revealed that toxic behavioural patterns of “pleasing” and
        the strong urge of human beings of wanting to “fit in” is one of the
        leading causes of depression. Often, we try so hard to force ourselves
        into spaces and realms where our presence is an unwelcome force. Our
        great desire for external affirmation and validation deludes us into
        thinking we need to presume a foreign façade in order to fit into those
        spaces and realms. I mean how often have we betrayed our own selves and
        worn a persona very different from who we authentically are in order to
        fit into those spaces? We even are willing to break and literally “cut
        off” parts of our beings in order to appease these realms in which our
        presence clearly is unwanted. Never lose your authenticity in any
        relation you form. Be it in relationships, friendships and even in
        corporate, never for any day, for whatever reason change and discard
        parts of yourself in order to assuage, conciliate, placate and to be
        accepted. Your authentic self is the highest form of currency that fuels
        all your virtues and definitely isn’t worth losing for anyone or
        anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        Social institutions like family, education, religion and legislation
        plays a colossal role in perpetuating the subliminal toxic doctrine of
        inauthenticity that society acclimates us to. From the socialization
        stage, society trains and teaches us that it is utterly wrong to behave
        in a certain manner or be of a certain manner even if that “manner” is
        your natural authentic true self. We are taught that it is unreservedly
        erroneous and wrong to live your own truth to the fullest if it comes
        across as deviating and non-conforming to the conventional set standards
        of normality. We are taught that it is wrong to like certain colours if
        you are of a certain gender. That it is wrong to dress in a certain
        manner. This has led many of us to stay on the fence and live a life
        that is invasive and pretentious merely because it is acceptable to
        social institutions even if it means deterring from who we really and
        authentically are.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other day I was baffled by Ugandan President; Mussoverni’s move of
        joining the ample list of African states criminalising an authentic
        state of being: same gender love. I am such a fan of love. A diehard fan
        of affection and like the fundamental human rights set by the United
        Nations, I also believe that anyone and everyone should have the liberal
        courtesy of loving and expressing companionship affection towards anyone
        they desire to regardless of gender and racial relations. It just hit me
        so hard how we live in a society that still frowns upon certain shades
        of love. It’s just unfortunate how the LGTQI+ community in Uganda and
        the likes has to now live a closet kind of life, shedding a huge chunk
        of their authenticity in order to appease the legislature that
        unapologetically dictates to them that they live in an inauthentic dud.
      </p>

      <p>
        An authentic person is fearless. One who dares to contest the normative
        standards set by any social institution. President Mussoverni’s move of
        adopting the anti-gay bill has irked members of the minority in Uganda,
        many taking to the streets protesting in a solid stance to preserve
        their natural authentic state of being. An authentic individual is one
        who refuses to be swayed by any external force endeavouring to
        disaffiliate them from their true identity. I was also fascinated by the
        hijab issue by a multitude of women in the Islamic state of Iran. Now
        for decades, Iranian women and women generally in many Islamic states
        are compelled by law to wear hijabs over their faces in public settings.
        Even if you feel suffocated and suppressed by the hijab policy, you have
        no choice whatsoever as a woman but to put on the hijab at all times or
        else face excruciating punishment including ail time. Even against the
        backdrop of this pugnacious statute by the Islamic government of Iran, a
        legion of Iranian women have decided it’s time to discard of the hijab
        policy and flaunt their beautiful faces and hair in public. Even with
        such a strong militant government, patriarchal to the core, those
        Iranian women decided they now have a voice and it’s time to use it in
        order to disentangle their authentic state of being that has been
        systematically suppressed for eons. This realisation of strength and a
        voice by these Iranian women echoes the sentiments made earlier on that
        authenticity unlocks an unsullied and heightened level of enlightenment.
      </p>

      <p>
        A perfect world, one worth living in, is the kind of world that places
        no captivity and infringement on our true selves but rather allows us
        the liberty to live our truth and authenticity. So never place a foray
        on your own authentic state of being. I’ll leave you with the cliché
        phrase; “be you”. Really though, be you!!! You are an embodiment of
        dazzling precision and candour if you embrace who you were truly meant
        to be.
