        Eswatini: A Land Fated By Digital Regression!

      <p class="article-start">
        The global digital economy is forever evolving with artificial
        intelligence constantly becoming an undeniable prime constitute of daily
        life for global civilisation. Forty years since the government
        established the Swaziland Post and Telecommunications Parastatal through
        the SPTC statute of 1983, digital development in the country seems to be
        rather regressive! The digital divide seems to be widening in an era
        where technology has rapidly taken over the human functioning of life.
        In a land where goats outpopulate people, the country is portentously
        lagging behind with one of the weakest digital economies in Sub Saharan
        Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
        The year 1994 was the most groundbreaking era in the history of
        technology in the Southern Hemisphere of the continent. MTN
        International set its corpus in the shores of South Africa introducing
        the country to its very first cellular mobile phone, a turning point in
        the digital realm of the country. A few years later in 1997 on the afore
        of Independence Day, King Mswati made the very first phone call as MTN
        South Africa had outfoxed Vodacom (previously Vodafone) in obtaining the
        official cellular mobile network connectivity license in the country.
        The interesting fact is that the SPTC had failed to convince the
        government that it had the capacity to establish a mobile network
        juxtaposition to its successful cable phone service from 1983 , a
        service which it had absolute monopoly over. Over the years this has
        propelled MTN to further a monopolistic dogma that has been a main
        driver of the digital inequality of the population as data has been an
        expensive artifact which many people can never bear to afford.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SPTC’s attempt to dethrone MTN off its mobile network provision
        stature in 2010 seemed to be a new dawn that would enhance digital
        transformation in the country and offer consumers of cheaper technology
        and mobile network rates. This was through SPTC”s creation of the ‘ONE’
        sim card network that would be the dawning of an new era in the terrain
        of mobile connectivity in the country. ONE, would also be a fixed
        wireless system that would contend with MTN. All seems amazing
        right?……in every shade, revolutionary!! right? This new era was
        short-lived as SPTC had breached a crucial clause in its agreement with
        MTN in the late nineties. This agreement known as the SPTC/MTN JVA
        ensured that King Mswati 111 had a substantial share in MTN. For him and
        the SPTC to continue enjoying the shares luxury at MTN, SPTC was
        disallowed by a certain clause in the agreement to never in its
        operations establish a mobile network connectivity service that would
        compete with them. This was a strategic move from MTN to pontificate an
        absolute totality of monopoly. The glory of the SPTC’s ONE network was
        obliterated by a ruling from the International Court of Arbitration in
        2012 which forced SPTC to close down the ONE network operations. The
        lack of proper competition in the mobile network sector of the country
        has been the arch contributor to the retrogressing of the digital
        economy of the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        The digital lagging-behind of the country is one of the chief reasons
        why 70% of the population will continue to languish in a wretched state
        of poverty. The digital revolution in the country is probably one of the
        slowest in the SADC region. This deprives the country of a wholesome
        economic growth. The Ministry of ICT has to adopt an array of policies
        which will oil the wheels of the digital revolution in the country. The
        unfortunate incompetencies of the Ministry of ICT is one of the reasons
        why the country could not achieve its “VISION 2022” policy of
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the government worked tirelessly to accelerate the pace of the
        diffusion of technology an array of economic productivity gains could
        have been long achieved in line with “VISION 2022”. The government has
        to break the moulds to achieve a stable digital economy. This will
        inject a boundless economic growth and the mass creation of employment
        opportunities within the technology sphere which the country dreadfully
        needs. Hopefully the state will consider hiring a vibrant devote ICT
        aficionado with an incomparable wealth of knowledge in as far as
        technology is concerned as an ICT Minister in the upcoming parliament.
        Ill-fatedly, the last five cabinet years for the ICT portfolio has been
        led by leader who hasn’t come to the fore in driving the mass revolution
        in the Digital arena of the country.
