        They call her black <br />
        But all I see is earth giving birth <br />
        To a goddess, a timeless present <br />
        Hold back your pity <br />
        For she is one so witty <br />
        Talk of a silent killer <br />
        With the vibe of a winner <br />
        So don't underestimate her beauty <br />
        She is a weapon walking <br />
        Doesn't need a gun <br />
        Just her voice which is a a silencer <br />
        So beware of her barrel <br />
        Because she never misses her shot <br />
        Wait, hold up <br />
        You haven't heard the best part yet <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        They call her black <br />
        I knew her as an ebony <br />
        Spoke internationally <br />
        But was silent to me <br />
        A body like a topography <br />
        I revolved within her orbits <br />
        Filled all her chambers <br />
        Coded side embroided <br />
        Dressed in metal jackets <br />
        Loaded questions <br />
        They couldn't hack it <br />
        With color to be untamed <br />
        What if beauty was her name <br />
        Haven't heard the best part yet <br />
        Yes the best lies within <br />
        Cocked back and let it spin <br />
        Her silence is only captioned by the wind <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        She is not just black <br />
        But a representation of facts <br />
        A vibrance of different shades of color <br />
        The rainbow got nothing on her <br />
        A kiss from the sun <br />
        Make her skin glow <br />
        Her voice makes thoughts pause <br />
        The world stops to revolve <br />
        You better hold on to the moment <br />
        No need for words <br />
        All you need are actions <br />
        Let her body do the talking <br />
        But be careful how you respond <br />
        Oh You might end up drowning <br />
        Wait......it's still not the best part!!! <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Colours peak into the absence of light <br />
        Melanin is our logo, not just case at night <br />
        Held onto those moment until they have swag <br />
        In the breeze <br />
        Hollow moments, I see shells of what used to be <br />
        She call them ghost I call them memories <br />
        Hair like the seas <br />
        Eyes window to her soul <br />
        Lashes be her burglar bars <br />
        Behind those in science of stars <br />
        Her voice can call out to me from a past life <br />
        And hear it as an epiphany currently <br />
        That caused my thoughts to pause <br />
        I need her touch her again to me my brain defrost <br />
        At any cost <br />
        But she's priceless I can bill everyone else <br />
        Stung by her gun, pooling for now <br />
        Have I drowned from what I've found <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Wait, hold up <br />
        You still haven't heard the best part <br />
        She is black!! <br />
      </p>
