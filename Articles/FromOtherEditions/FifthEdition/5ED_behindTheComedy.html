        First word I think of whenever the name of this formidable man comes up
        is “pioneer”. In every sense this man is a creative trendsetter whose
        impeccable contribution in the arts industry of the country has
        revolutionised the game in its own distinct right. A peerless custodian
        of astounding entertainment who has kept audiences on the edges of their
        seats with their jaws on the floor with laughter over the years. Known
        for his matchless “Gogo and Slwane” skits, Ncamiso Ntshingila with an
        impressive creative arts catalogue has made a name for himself as a
        sought-after comedian, writer, producer, director, actor and dancer.
        This article pursues to unveil the mask off the face of this comedy
        powerhouse and voyages around the experiences and highlights of his
        laudable career with marginal insights on his personal life.
      </p>
      <p>
        From setting global stages ablaze with his nonpareil theatrical
        performances to sharing comedic stages with the likes of Celeste Ntuli,
        to starring in the most successful film the country has ever produced to
        date, Slwane has always been an entertainer from a very young age. “My
        former schoolmates always remind me of how wayward I was in school”, he
        reminisces of how he has always been “the funny guy” for as long as he
        can remember. Growing up in the small community of Matara in Ngwenya,
        Ntshingila was raised by a single mother and he attributes his
        upbringing to the iconic man he has turned out to be today. “Growing up
        without my father made me decide that I wanted to be a present father to
        my kids”, the father of one beautiful baby girl enunciates on his core
        principles as a present father in his daughter’s life. You cannot begin
        to even ignore the warmth on his voice the very moment he speaks of his
        daughter. “She changed my life”, the comedian beaming with pride says of
        his daughter, crediting her for ameliorating his life and making him see
        life from different lenses. With family being his arch support system,
        Ncamiso acknowledges his mother for supporting his dream of pursuing a
        career in a rather winding creative arts landscape in the country.
      </p>
      <h4>The beginning of the voyage: PELEPELE CULTURAL GROUP</h4>
      <div class="article-images">

          href="/images/FifthEdition/YoungPeopleOnTheMove/Slwane/5ED_behindTheComedy_pelepeleGroup.jpg"

            class="cover-image"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        The atomic genesis of Ncamiso’s story begins at Ngwenya Village, where
        his family moved to in his teenage years. The inception seed of his
        career was sworn when he joined a peer educator programme at Ngwenya
        Town. Being a part of the programme as a peer educator supervisor
        exposed Ncamiso to an entirely different world that changed his life
        forever. The doors of the alluring tapestry of drama were opened to him
        through a series of drama workshops, the programme offered. That is when
        Ncamiso first tasted the euphoric illusion of performance and since then
        he never again wanted to ever sober up from the ecstasy the art of drama
        and performance gave him. It was during this creative trance that he met
        with industry giants including entertainment entrepreneur and artist
        manager Larry Mhlanga who was a key catalyst in opening international
        doors for Ncamiso through the globally renowned; Pelepele dance group.
        What Larry Mhlanga conceptualized initially as a Marimba band grew to
        become unarguably the best dance and cultural arts group the country has
        every seen. Promoted to being Larry’s second-in-command as an assistant
        director of the group, Ncamiso alongside his Pelepele crew members had a
        medley of successful International sold-out tours in Europe, Dubai and
        USA between 2013-2014. Pelepele was also selected to participate in an
        international dance competition in South Korea with an over E5 Million
        prize at stake. The group enjoyed a successful international footprint
        and revolutionized the entertainment scene in Eswatini. The two-time
        National Arts and Culture Awars winning group was in every sense an
        academy and an incubation ground for many young creatives in the country
        whom have gone on to have illustrious individual careers. One of these
        creatives is famed comedian: SMALLZ who has gone on to enjoy
        cross-border success too.
      </p>
      <h4>UMJINGI UDLIWA YINHLITIYO</h4>
      <p>
        A principled theatre practitioner with years of intense stage acting
        training, Ncamiso’s next move was the big screen. The year 2015 saw him
        land a leading role in the acclaimed Mzansi-Magic produced movie:
        Umjingi Udliwa Inhlitiyo, a tale of forbidden love based on the novel by
        seasoned writer: Sijabulile Nsibandze. A part he was reluctant in
        auditioning for, he never could have predetermined how successful the
        film would turn out to be. Starring as the funny hopeless romantic:
        “Lusekwane”, he had instant chemistry with onscreen romance flame,
        Hloniphile Ndzimande. The connection and chemistry the had in the movie
        could remind one of the chemistry Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet had
        in the movie: Titanic. With acting being somewhat his nature, Ncamiso
        had zero struggles from adapting from his usual niche: theatre
        performance to performing in an entirely different acting sphere, film.
        Infact in his true “Jack of All Trades and Master of them all” nature,
        Ncamiso recalls how he was a one-take wonder throughout the shooting of
        the movie much to director: Modison Magagula’s amazement. “The director
        was blown away with how I knew the whole script and how I never
        struggled with my lines”, Ncamiso reminiscences of his time in the what
        is undoubtably the first Swati film to reach BoxOffice success of
        matchless magnitude . He stresses the importance of telling our own
        stories to authentic accord,unapologetically so! With a slowly
        developing arts landscape, Ncamiso implores the government to put its
        money where its mouth is in fast tracking the progression of the
        struggling industry. The film remains one of Slwane’s highlights in the
        creative fraternity.

      </div>
      <h4>A MAN BEHIND THE SCENES: The birth of GOGO and SLWANE</h4>
      <p>
        Ncamiso served as the creative engine behind comedy giant: SMALLZ THE
        COMEDIAN designing his skits and writing his comedic monologues.
        Ncamiso’s contribution to SMALLZ’s career availed him to participate and
        win the coveted LOL comedy search competition which quickly asserted him
        as a comedy household name. What is incontestably the most monumental
        career move the comedy eccentric has taken to date is being a part of
        the peerless comedy trio: “The Merchants of Bottomless Laughter”
        consisting of SMALLZ, himself and Mduduzi Nkhambule ( “GOGO”). The trio
        were not about to fathom the leaps their comedy skits would take them
        to. The ensemble quickly rose to fame making it the most successful
        comedy group in the country to date. Ncamiso continued to utilize the
        scriptwriting experience he has in formulating skits for the ensemble.
        With Facebook video uploads garnering hundreds of thousands of views,
        the Bottomless Laughter trio begun to enjoy prominence in neighbouring
        countries like South Africa, setting South Africa comedy stages alight!
      </p>

          href="/images/FifthEdition/YoungPeopleOnTheMove/Slwane/5ED_behindTheComedy_gogo.jpg"
          ><img
            src="/images/FifthEdition/YoungPeopleOnTheMove/Slwane/5ED_behindTheComedy_gogo.jpg"
            alt=""
            class="cover-image"
        /></a>
      </div>

      <p>
        The departure of SMALZZ from the ensemble in 2021 did not deter GOGO and
        SLWANE from constantly pushing the envelope in the comedy sphere. The
        GOGO and SLWANE brand is the leading marque in as far as comedy is
        concerted in the country. Known for being trendsetters of note and a
        marketer’s biggest dream, the “GOGO&SLWANE” brand is easily the ultimate
        apple of the eye of many corporate companies at the moment right now.
        This is evident through the duo’s partnership and brand-ambassadorship
        with big players in corporate including United Holdings and Nedbank to
        name a few. It is safe to say that Ncamiso has learnt something that
        most performers in the country fail to comprehend: the art of
        understanding the business side of the game! The management of the group
        by Nzimeni Mpanza has also been one of the chief ingredients in driving
        the brand to success. Ncamiso acknowledges the fact that the brand has
        grown in leaps and bounds to become a beast bigger than them and their
        minimal fathoming.
      </p>
      <p>
        The level of incomprehensible love Ncamiso has for his duo partner is
        insanely heartening. He cannot stop raving about the unrivalled talent
        Mduduzi has. He without any doubt aprimmes Gogo as the most talented
        creative he has ever worked with his entire career. The relationship
        between the two comedy heavyweights transcends the walls of a comedy
        arena, according to Ncamiso, they have become more than just colleagues
        and business partners. “I’d like to say keep pushing man, the sky is the
        limit even if my presence is not with you one day, YOU ARE WHAT THE
        WORLD NEEDS”, said Ncamiso in a big brotherly tone when I asked him to
        share any message, he has always wanted to convey to Mduduzi.
      </p>
      <h4>The Future</h4>
      <p>
        As an individual arts practitioner, Ncamiso wants to continue stretching
        the fringe. He is currently working on a movie titled: “Nguye Longuye”,
        a movie he wrote and directed himself, starring Mduduzi “GOGO” Nkhambule
        as part of the cast. This amplifies the volume on the level of artistic
        maturity this seasoned thespian and comedian is on and his future seems
        to be dominated by a lot of creative growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Known to be one not selfish on giving his nuggets of experienced wisdom
        to aspiring art creatives, Ncamiso is passionate about contributing to
        the growing of the arts sector in grassroots level. He is constantly
        invited to art development workshops around the country where he curates
        and lends his artistic advice budding performers. To the aspiring
        Ncamiiso somewhere in Nkiliji or Lavumisa with dreams of achieving
        renowned successes in the arts medium as Ncamiso has, the seasoned
        artist warns the young and upcoming artists against the dreaded demon
        called “fame”. According to Ncamiso one has to obsess with perfecting
        the craft to the pinnacle of their abilities before chasing fame.
        Despite all the fame Ncamiso in still in touch with his spiritual
        clinch, serving as a conductor and chorister amongst other duties in his
        spiritual home: The Old Apostolic Church. A fun fact that most people
        apart from his fellow church members are clueless in knowing is his love
        for singing and serving in the OPC Ministry.
      </p>
      <p>
        A story of ambition and not letting your background define and hinder
        you from reaching your dreams, Ncamiso’s Spark is one that refuses to
        glow dimly but is in constant evolution. All eyes on him as he continues
        to be amongst the tier of individuals revolutionizing the creative arts
        terrain of the country. A pioneer of note who will go down as one of the
        people that laid the foundation work for the existence of performance
        arts in the country and broke ground for the pontification of comedy in
        the mainstream scene. A trailblazing entertainment legend of our time!
