        FROM THE SOCCER PITCH TO NAVIGATING THE FASHION WORLD:THE UNTOLD STORY
        OF MPENDULO NGIDI
      </h1>
      <p class="author">By Dallas Day</p>
      <p class="article-date">Last edited: September 16, 2023</p>
      <p class="article-start">
        By far one of the most talented, industrious midfielders Eswatini has
        ever witnessed, most sports fundis would agree with me that Ngidi is a
        marvel to watch, his stylish displays in the soccer field makes one to
        not regret purchasing the matchday ticket. The fact that he is still yet
        to represent the senior national team with pride is still a mystery. It
        goes without any iota of doubt that the name “Mpendulo Ngidi” will
        forever be engraved in memories of soccer supporters especially those
        who hail from the Lubombo region after being the captain of the Titanic
        “Tambuti” ship which sailed into the MTN Premier league after an absence
        of over a decade in the premiership.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ngidi is a living testimony of the adage which says “teach them young”
        as his illustrious career began at the age of 8 playing for Mhlaleni
        United under 13’s the rest is history. He has then since been the worst
        enemy of opposition defence as he terrorised them with defence splitting
        passes which made them to pry open like the biblical red sea at Moses
        and the israelites’ behest. He was captain fantastic of the dreadful
        Tambuti side which won the MTN first division league thus securing
        premiership status, they were also Mbabane Highlanders’ worst nightmare
        as they dehorned the bulls in a high intense Eswatini Bank quarter final
        fixture in 2017. He guided “bafana bemawolintji” as they are famously
        known donning the famous number 10 jersey worn by legends of the game
        from Pele to Maradona to Seven- time Balloon Dor winner Lionel Messi but
        most significantly Tsholofelo Teko “navigator” Modise whom Ngidi draws
        inspiration from hence he is also called the navigator. It goes without
        saying that when you think of Navigator you picture him on the soccer
        field delivering champagne passes, scoring monumental goal like the one
        which he scored on the final day in the 2017/18 season which ensured
        that Tambuti are champions. This well refined article in contrary will
        focus on his own clothing line “UNGA PRESS” and how went from being a
        soccer star into a fashion mogul.

      <h4>INSPIRATION</h4>
      <p>
        Even though he is now engaged in the fashion space he is still married
        to the game as even the name of his fashion Brand “UNGA PRESS’ is a
        football term that means “don’t close the opponent quickly”. This
        language is peculiar to football stars. As in the book titled I can read
        with my eyes shut the legendary DR Seuss says “The more you read, the
        more things you will know. The more places you will go” Navigator drew
        motivation from reading the Premier Soccer League Galatico Teko Modise’s
        book titled “The Curse Of Teko Modise”. This shows that the power of
        reading can enlighten one to venture into life changing measures. It
        seems that Teko is a role model for Ngidi in all spheres of life thus it
        is of paramount importance to not just look up to someone but to take
        action in order to reach greater heights, motivation without action,
        love and a never die attitude is meaningless.

      <h4>UNIQUENESS</h4>
      <p>
        UNGA PRESS ranges from sporty trendy outwear of high quality which makes
        it a must have for necessary social approval. The beautiful brand
        consists of stylish t-shirts, hats, sweaters, summer friendly shorts.
        One can easily spot the brand as unique as it is suitable for everyone
        despite age, gender, race and sexual orientation. This means that it is
        by far non discriminatory thus fitting like a glove in the modern
        fashion space. In true Rich Mnisi standards the brand offers seasonal
        clothing items like recently the summer clothing has been displayed to
        gear up for the highly anticipated summer season.
      </p>
      <h4>SUPPORT</h4>
      <p>
        This groundbreaking must have brand has been booming since it’s
        inception in 2020 all thanks to relatives, friends, soccer lovers who
        consumes it frequently. It is also vital to blow the horns for his team
        Tambuti FC which promotes personal development of their trusted
        soldiers, they are arguably the number one purchasers of the brand.
        Their players look absolutely classy in their UNGA PRESS sportswear
        during press briefings similar to the beautiful birds of Moroka in South
        Africa which proudly dons DRIP clothing which is owned by a black
        fashion mogul named Lekau Sehoana. This highlights how seriously African
        teams nowadays priorities individual development of their players and
        their financial security.

        /></a>
      </div>
      <h4>DRIVE</h4>
      <p>
        Ngidi’s secret success recipe is determination, respect and kindness in
        which he believes it can take one very far in life. Many would agree
        that we have seen former national treasures in the soccer scene became
        charity cases after retirement thus Ngidi’s best advice to present
        soccer players is that football is a short career it is best to invest
        in business for life after football. In the near future the Navigator
        aspires to navigate the international fashion space by storm and spread
        the beautiful UNGA PRESS distinct colours to the world at large. The
        lethal weapon in Tambuti’s arsenal who now doubles as the team’s Under
        19’s gaffer may require sunglasses as the future looks brighter for him.
        Last but not least “Dream big it is possible” (Ngidi 2023)
