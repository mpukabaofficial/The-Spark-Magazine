        The 2023 Preliminary elections: An exodus of “unfulfilled” promises!

      <p class="article-start">
        Thabisile Ndlela, a 55-year-old widow residing under the Kwaluseni
        constituency has been living in a wretched manner of state since the
        demise of her husband ten good years ago. Her day’s routine begins early
        in the uneasy epochs of the morning where the only option bequeathed to
        her is gathering her stock up and walking a good couple of kilometres to
        her fruits and vegetables mini stall, a dreary routine she’s been
        accustomed to for the past 8 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        She barely can fulfil any of her ends meet. In a crippled economy with
        the recent economic bulletin published by the Ministry of Economic
        Planning indicating a devastating elevated inflation of 5.7% in the
        second quarter of 2023 alone, Ndlela is a personified statistic amongst
        the 70% of individuals living subordinate the poverty margin. Residing
        in a poorly structured rented house in the Mbhuleni fragment of the
        Kwaluseni Inkhundla , electricity is a foreign commodity she has been
        struggling to afford for 3 weeks! Adding to the already thorn-pierced
        scar of the ordinary electorate, the Eswatini Electricity Company added
        a whooping 6.6% tariff on the price of electricity units in April this
        year. Thabisile is one of the many politically parochial electorates
        whose votes have been exploited by legislators without fulfilling any of
        their manifesto promises by the time they leave legislative office.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enthusiastic about voting, Thabisile joined a multitude of people at the
        Swazi National school voting station, gathered to exercise their
        constitutional right to vote under the Tinkhundla dispensation. On the
        ground many people like Ndlela were fervent about casting their vote at
        the polls. The universal consensus among the electorate is the change
        they are optimistic in seeing. Fully aware that the past five years have
        been another medley of poor service delivery, the electorate under the
        Kwaluseni constituency seem sure that by virtue of crossing that ballot
        paper X, an array of issues will be addressed by the new set of
        legislators they will choose.
      </p>
      <p>
        The poll stations were abuzz, a sight of patriotism. With the Friday
        raging winds threatening to put the electoral process into disrepute,
        the electorate raised up to the occasion and were in collective accord.
        The Elections and Boundaries Commission was the anchor that kept the
        entire process afloat. The EBC had previously pledged to provide special
        voting booths to disabled individuals, a promise that failed to see the
        light of day as no special provision was made for the differently abled
        electorate. Melusi Mthethwa, member of the Eswatini Disability Forum
        expressed his utter disappointment on the EBC’s failure to cater for the
        disabled electorate. “As members of the disabled community, we felt
        excluded from these elections and most of us could not exercise our
        rights enshrined in the constitution because nothing much was done to
        aid us to vote”, avowed Mthethwa on the Forum’s disappointment on the
        EBC’s failure to cater for the needs of disabled people in the Primary
        elections. The Coordinating Assembly of Non-profit Organisations(CANGO)
        which was the given the role of monitoring the voting process expressed
        disappointment on the manner in which the EBC failed to be inclusive of
        disabled people. “There is need to address the needs of people living
        with disabilities especially access to polling stations. Polling
        Stations should be made accessible to disabled people especially those
        physical disabled and provisions of transport be made for all disabled
        people to access polling stations’, read the primary elections report
        published on the afternoon of Monday the 28th of August.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CANGO Preliminary report also alludes that the political system that
        the country operates under is a call for concern as it does not
        represent the democratic project in-par with international standards.
        “It is a recommendation of this report that Eswatini should consider
        constitutional and legislative changes that would allow individual merit
        to run alongside political party participation in the elections”. The
        empty promises made by the monarchical institution tying itself to a
        national dialogue seem to be taking the winds off the sails of the mass
        democratic movement in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last five legislative years were nothing but unprecedented. From a
        civil unrest, a worst inflation in ten years to a debauched health
        crisis responsible for the loss of life of many EmaSwati and the
        impartiality of the judicial system put under atomic scrutiny after the
        ruling of the incarcerated former legislators. The outgoing Mps will
        probably be mentioned in history as the instigators of the most
        thread-bared legislative eras the country has seen in years. An exodus
        of unfulfilled promises will be pontificated if the electorate continues
        to make uninformed choices when electing an MP.
