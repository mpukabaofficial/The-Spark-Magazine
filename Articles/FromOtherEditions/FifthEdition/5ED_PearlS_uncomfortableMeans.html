      <p class="article-start">
        The question of how can I succeed in spite of the influence of societal
        and economic disparities often troubles my mind. It often leads me to
        calculating what it is I have at my disposal and what I can do with it
        to achieve growth on a personal and economic level. To an almost
        discouraging level, I often do not find an answer to that question but
        more questions arise. There are times that I come up with theories that
        constantly are a result of my external environment. I often engage
        people who have similar views to mine and people who have, at times,
        opposing perspectives to my own. I enjoy talking to people who have
        different experiences to mine, in varying spheres of life, because they
        have knowledge in areas I am not familiar with. The main theme of these
        discussions I have is on the goal of education.
      </p>

      <h4>The Goal of Education</h4>
      <p>
        There is a dominant school of thought which indoctrinates us into
        believing that education is the key to success. To be clear, I do not
        dispute this nor do I believe that education is a standalone key to
        success, but I digress. There are barriers to education, on another
        level, there are barriers to good education. By barrier to education I
        mean barrier of entry into institutions of learning from preschool to
        tertiary. The question is, “If one cannot afford to enroll in these
        institutions, what can they do?” This question brought me to think more
        about the goal of education and whether it is possible to achieve it
        outside of a formal institution. If yes, does an individual have to wait
        to enter a ‘formal’ institution or they can find ways to reach their
        greatest potential without school.
      </p>

      <div class="quote quote-color-charcoal dark">
        <p>
          “Reading furnishes the mind only with materials of knowledge; it is
          thinking that makes what we read ours.” ~John Locke
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The goal of education is to impart knowledge and that will help develop
        people’s skill that can potentially open up opportunities for financial
        gain. So, when the opportunities for a formal education are dim, the
        alternative is to pursue knowledge using other means. This requires a
        level of discipline where one can sacrifice short term wants for greater
        future gains. As an example, if one has hundred Rands ($7) to spend on
        alcohol, entertainment in social media, clothes they do not need. If one
        affords to do this monthly or once every three months, they still can be
        able to use that amount to acquire more knowledge. I am also an example,
        I kept my hair short for a whole year, something foreign to me, in order
        to redirect the money, I used to use for elaborate hairstyles, into
        other areas. I can assure you, I am not one of those privileged and look
        good with short hair.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many more ways in which we can acquire more information to
        build our knowledge. We still have libraries in this day and age, not to
        mention the internet; furthermore, there is a television in most homes
        and with the most basic level subscription which has informative
        channels too. They might be boring, some may sleep through most of them;
        however, that knowledge one can get from those channels will accumulate
        and they might be more knowledgeable than those who sat through school.
        There all kinds of lessons: some provide business tips, some provide
        life hacks, and some provide skills that helps people optimize the
        resources they have at their disposal. To be honest, university gives
        its attendees a guide on which books to read then sends students to the
        internet to actually learn. Libraries also offer books that are not even
        prescribed that could help gain further knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is another source of knowledge, and that is from those who have
        experience in life, whether they are deemed to have been successful or
        not. They should not be judged them for how they turned out, but one can
        identify what they can learn about their successes and failures. The aim
        is to know what made them persistent as they faced the obstacles on
        their way.
      </p>

      <div class="quote quote-color-navy-blue dark">
        <p>
          “There are three principal means of acquiring knowledge…observation of
          nature, reflection, and experimentation. Observation collects facts;
          reflection combines them; experimentation verifies the result of their
          combination.” ~Denis Diderot
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        As much as formal education is an advantage not it is not entirely
        detrimental to your success. The first thing that informs me that you
        can acquire more information is that you are reading this article – and
        it is online – imagine what more you can find that could be beneficial
        to you. I believe that everyone has the ability to change the direction
        of their lives and make an impact on the lives of people around them.
        Some people have been born in disadvantaged circumstances but have made
        it a point to use the opportunities right in front of them, making an
        impact in the world. The sure path to failure idleness, educated or not.
