      <p class="article-start">
        I arrived in eSwatini on August 10, 2023, about 2 years since I left. I
        pride myself of my country primarily because it was able to make me to
        be the person I am today. I feel like I have an obligation to give back
        or at least pay taxes for more people to have similar opportunities as
        me and better. To those who know me on a personal level know how much I
        believe in its potential. I have even written three articles expressing
        my disappointment after knowing that the dream vision 2022 was
        nullified. Coming back home was something that meant the world to me,
        seeing my mother and sister brought the biggest smile on my face and
        peace and comfort I haven’t felt in a while. Getting outside though, I
        wasn’t so happy. Do not get me wrong, there has been progress and
        development. I saw the Manzini to Sikhuphe Airport highway and it is
        phenomenal. It is world class – it even has solar lights! But the
        unemployment rate is disheartening, no scholarships and it is at a point
        where survival is nearing impossible. I have high standards for eSwatini
        and people are telling me to relax and just ride the wave. I cannot. I
        will not. I can’t dare do that. This is not a joke, emaSwati need to
        have a better life and for us to get there I believe that we should aim
        for high standards.
      </p>

      <p>
        My arrival in my country was to visit my family and also investigate the
        state of my country. I did not need to look further from my family.
        Things we used to afford were now unattainable. Worker wages might have
        been increased but their standard of living is gradually worsening. What
        is causing that? What is it that we constantly do as emaSwati that is
        making us grow worse? Why is our middle class shrinking quicker than a
        plastic exposed to fire? Why are things objectively and subjectively
        worse? Are things worsening? What is happening? I do not know much,
        mainly because I do not live in the country 24/7, but I think something
        is going terribly wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been wring a lot about the state of education in the country.
        Education is a weapon and if we do not sharpen it we become powerless.
        Eswatini is a small country and we need to realize that our land area
        poses us a lot of challenges when competing in the global market. Some
        countries plant a thousandth of their land and the area is as big as our
        country if not more. We cannot expect to compete with that. As we all
        know, the larger the production the cheaper the cost per unit. What
        makes it even worse is that we do not have access to the sea for trade –
        that is another one of many obstacles we need to gallop in the process
        of building our economy. But knowledge is limitless. Knowledge knows no
        bounds. If we invest in our education we stand a chance in being an
        important country in the global economy. But I do not know what is the
        problem. Is it the teachers? Are teachers hungry enough to bring us high
        level education or school has become a factory where as long as they
        tick the relevant boxes, it is all okay? But why would I even expect
        teachers to be passionate about their work if they can hardly afford
        anything. If the minds of teachers are constantly flooded by the
        frustration of losing their contracts in a year or two why would they
        spend time improving the very same thing that threatens their survival?
        I feel as if eSwatini is in a vicious cycle that can result is
        catastrophic results.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of my biggest boasts as a Swazi, is knowing that our passport (as
        bad as it is in the global stage) is really good in the African
        continent. We can go to a lot of countries without a visa and we a
        likely to be allowed a visa. That may change real soon. Why? More
        emaSwati are leaving home and resorting to find other countries to live
        in. We may have the status of a peaceful country, it is becoming evident
        that it reminiscent of a cold war – something is happening under the
        hood. Are we seeing the mass migration of our intelligent brains? This
        is very bad. A hand is important – but a human can live without a hand
        but without a brain – life is impossible. Eswatini is slowly becoming a
        brainless country. We have a huge problem of brain drain. Before we had
        people go abroad, sharpen their skills, come back and cultivate in the
        land. Now, it is means to flee the country! I am very concerned. I am
        concerned for the country and its future. My brother is an engineer and
        hasn’t been hired in a long time. I have seen his work. I attest that he
        is one of the most intelligent minds in engineering and architecture and
        yet he is not hired. I'm not rigidly in favour of pure meritocracy. I
        believe in a balanced approach where opportunities aren't solely
        reserved for those who excel at something. Instead, they should be
        distributed fairly to ensure everyone's well-being. I also believe
        intelligent people should be awarded because people are good at
        different things, and whatever they are good at, they should be awarded
        for them. The country is not careful with its resources but chooses to
        waste them. Somethings up and it is not going to end well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love eSwatini because it is welcoming to any and every immigrant. Of
        course there nationals from foreign countries that face discrimination
        and racism but we have had a few cases if any that show that eSwatini is
        dangerous for immigrants. I want that to event get better for any
        national knowing that they can be in the country and it will be their
        home. However, I encountered a problem that disturbed me which was that
        I wanted to support a Swazi owned business and that was difficult. Why
        don’t emaSwati practise entrepreneurship? Are they not innovative
        enough? Or are the scales tipped? I advocate for everyone to be treated
        equally in any country despite anything. I do not do much maths now but
        I can see that there is something wrong if 9/10 businesses are not Swazi
        in a place with more than 90% Swazi population. Somethings really
        strange. Very strange.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a small country and we need to acknowledge that we can change
        greatly and become better. We cannot be heading straight off a cliff and
        act like everything is fine. Let us all be aware of what is at stake:
        this is real life! I am not implying that emaSwati aren’t doing anything
        but I am saying that radical action needs to be taken in improving the
        country for the better. This applies in all level: personally, in our
        communities and everyone. I urge those who have left the country with no
        intention to comeback to consider contributing in one way or another
        because our fellow emaSwati are not thriving but surviving a crisis –
        one that will need collective work.
