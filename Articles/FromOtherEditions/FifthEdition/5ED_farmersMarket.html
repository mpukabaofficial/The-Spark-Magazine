        ESWATINI FARMERS MARKET-SECOND EDITION "A MUST GO TO EVENT"
      </h1>
      <p class="author">By Lusanda King</p>

      <p class="article-start">
        People around the world love to have a good time, whether it's at a
        sports game or a concert. They plan their outfits weeks in advance and
        come together to let loose and have fun. The African concept of Ubuntu,
        or humanity and togetherness, really comes through in these moments.
        It's great to see everyone celebrating together, living in the moment
        and enjoying themselves. The Eswatini Farmers Market is more than just
        an event - it's a celebration of humanity, community, and connection.
        From the shared conversations in the bathroom to the random acts of
        generosity and kindness sharing rides drinks and rides back home, the
        experience of being at the Farmers Market is something special. The
        second editions theme, "Show Them Legs," is sure to make this event even
        more fun and memorable. This is a not-to-be-missed experience that will
        leave a lasting impression on everyone who attends.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Spark Magazine sought out the festival director-Culolam Dlamini to
        learn more about the plans for the second edition of the event, which
        will take place on September 9th at Sibebe Resort . As I was browsing
        social media, I noticed that people were discussing the change of venue
        for the event, from Malkerns to Sibebe Resort. There was concern about
        the increased travel distance and cost for attendees, but the event
        organizers responded with a statement explaining their decision. They
        explained that the change was necessary due to logistical and safety
        concerns, and that they had worked to keep the event accessible and
        affordable for everyone.

      <h4>Event description and its primary goals</h4>
      <p>
        The event aims to support small and medium-sized businesses by providing
        networking opportunities and a platform to showcase their products and
        services to a wider audience. It is hoped that by combining business and
        entertainment, businesses can stay relevant and connect with their
        target audience in a more meaningful way. As the world continues to
        change and evolve, it is important for businesses to adapt and use a
        variety of methods to reach their target market.

      <h4>Inspiration behind the event</h4>
      <p>
        The Eswatini Farmers Market was inspired by two well-known events in
        Eswatini: The Bushfire Festival and Pop Sunday. The Bushfire Festival is
        a large, international event that attracts visitors from all over the
        world. It combines music, art, and culture in a way that is unique and
        exciting. Pop Sunday, on the other hand, is a more relaxed event that
        gives people the opportunity to unwind and reconnect. The Eswatini
        Farmers Market in collaboration with El World aim to combine the best
        aspects of these two events to create something truly special.

      <h4>The first edition</h4>

      <p>
        The first edition of the Eswatini Farmers Market was a massive success,
        with over 4,000 attendees enjoying an evening of music, food, and fun.
        The event generated a lot of buzz on social media, with people sharing
        their experiences and excitement online. The lineup of performers was
        impressive, with Msaki, SunEl Musician, Simmy, and Bholoja all putting
        on incredible shows. Msaki's powerful vocals and SunEl Musician's
        infectious beats had the crowd dancing the night away. Simmy's
        performance was a surprise for many, and her unique sound was a hit with
        the audience. Our very own Eswatini star Bholoja put a show with a 5
        piece band from South and it was nothing short of amazing
      </p>
