        Do you remember the last time you felt the sting lavished by rejection?
        Was it that guy that never returned your calls? The friends who made
        plans without you? A father that never came around? Or was it that one
        person in your life that never saw your worth no matter how hard you
        tried to do everything and anything to impress them? Well, we all know
        that rejection excruciates, it unearths the greatest and peerless
        collective ounces of pain. Many times I have wallowed in the deep-cut
        wounds rejection has left me with, a countless number of times.
        Recently, something hit me and I realized that wallowing in the pits dug
        and crafted by rejection is not logical, it really isn’t. You see our
        lives can change if we only realized to ourselves that rejection isn’t
        an arch enemy but our friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day we realize that rejection is not a measure of our impeccable
        value but a testament of another person’s inward turmoil, our lives will
        change! I plead to you to probe rejection and cast it as a psychological
        projection. Rejection is an apparatus that orchestrates a refocus of our
        fundamental objectives. It goes without any saying that we for many
        occasions, tend to use rejection as a price tag for our self-worth. A
        belligerent attack to our fragile self-esteems, eating away every atom
        of our physiques. And that is a very lethal manner of having a panoramic
        look at rejection. Today I want you to look at and use rejection as a
        fuelling mechanism for growth!

        I love Nina Simone dearly and I try and implement some of the nuggets
        from her life story in my own life. I wonder if she still would have
        been one of history’s greatest musical starlets if a multitude of record
        labels didn’t reject her a countless number times before she finally hit
        the high note of stardom and got her big break. Do you ever sit and
        notice this cliché but realistic trend of success? How every success
        story has a painful genesis of rejection, countless rejections? I mean
        look at tech giant Apple. In a parallel universe, do you really think
        the IPhone would be such a powerhouse of a brand if the late pioneer;
        Steve Jobs didn’t face such several rejections from his own company? I
        do not think my political idol; Steve Biko would be such a historical
        maverick if his mission of Black Consciousness wasn’t rejected by a
        multitude of masses. All the iconic individuals mentioned here have one
        thing in common. Instead of languishing and wallowing in the pain spewed
        by rejection, they leverage those moments of rejection to their
        wholesome advantage.
      </p>

      <p>
        The human brain and overall psychology is a distinctively powerful
        medley of tissues. Setting negative goals after getting rejected will
        without any doubt send equally negative impulses to the brain, and the
        brain as per its function will most definitely dispense negative
        reactions, and negativity will manifest itself all around you. I have
        noticed how each and every time I label myself as a “failure” or a
        “loser “ after getting rejected, my life responds to that negative label
        and everything around me begins to react and to affirm just how much of
        a bare failure and loser I really am. Winners aren’t really defined by
        the accolades and 1st place positions they have secured, in my opinion
        winners are sought after for the number of times they steadfastly never
        allowed their spark to fade, no matter how hard rejections have tried to
        dim their spark’s glow. Instead winners leverage rejection by using it
        as a concrete building block for success! Okay so your man breaks up
        with you today and you’re going to spend the next one million years
        asking yourself if you aren’t beautiful enough? Wallowing in self-pity
        and a diminished self-esteem? Or are you going to use that moment of
        rejection to grow as an individual and set ablaze new horizons? Choose
        the latter!

        I will never forget the day I was primed to be amongst the school
        prefects back in high school. I was among the top achievers in my grade
        and my mates kept feeding me this crap that I was going to be selected
        as one of the new school prefects. Well names got called out, me and my
        friends waiting in baited breathes for my name to be called, I mean it
        was only logical for my name to be called out too. But guess what? My
        name was not even called out for class monitor. And what made things
        worse was the fact that two people whom I was academically superior to
        made it to the prefects’ list!! Assembly got dismissed and my shoulders
        got slumped with my head bowed so low in utter disappointment. With the
        little confidence and zero wisdom I had then, I spent the next years of
        my high school ruining my life. My marks suffered greatly and I
        occasionally got into fights, suspensions and detentions because I had
        decided to let that moment of rejection to define me. Instead of using
        that moment as fuel to work even harder, I set out negative goals from
        that moment of rejection. I decided that I was now a; Loser, a Failure
        and a Disappointment! And guess what? My life began to respond to those
        negative goals and everything that happened to me affirmed my theory
        that I was indeed one big loser. I blamed myself for not being “good
        enough” instead of acknowledging that I never made it to the prefects’
        list because of the Principal’s preference and not because of my
        self-worth. Thank goodness for this recent enlightenment because I now
        know that my moments of rejection are never a reflection of whom and
        what I truly am. And I will never be defined by any of my past, present
        and future rejections. That high school rejection doesn’t overshadow my
        dream to one day own one of the biggest PR firms this continent has ever
        seen. And it doesn’t mean I am incapable of leading and managing people.
        That moment of rejection has zero bearing on my leadership skills.
      </p>

        See, I do not know the hurdle of rejection that you’re faced with at the
        moment. I’m unaware of the manner of rejection you have been punched in
        the face with, but what I do know is the fact that you aren’t defined by
        that current moment of rejection! Leverage that sting to your advantage.
        Use that rejection as motivation to continue scratching deep within
        yourself, deep till you find that passion. Find that passion and anchor
        it with purpose. Ignite your spark and let it burn so fiercely!
