          “I prefer to be true to myself, even at the hazard of incurring the
          ridicule of others, rather than to be false, and to incur my own
          abhorrence.” ― Frederick Douglass

        Self-esteem is not a constant or something allotted to us at birth. Like
        all great human characteristics, self-esteem is malleable. It can be
        weakened and reduced, diluted and lost, but it can also be strengthened
        and heightened, developed and found. The beautiful thing about
        self-esteem is that it does not rely on external metrics, such as our
        appearance, wealth, family background, or skill set. This does not mean
        that a person with good self-esteem cannot be rich or skilled, but
        rather that good self-esteem leads to external metrics, not the other
        way around. Nor does it mean that everyone with high self-esteem is
        'successful'. However, those with high self-esteem share one thing we
        all wish to have: satisfaction. I believe that self-esteem is a vital
        factor in determining the course of your life. Therefore, this writing
        will consist of three parts: what self-esteem is, why it is important,
        and what causes it to increase or decrease.
      </p>

      <p>
        Firstly, what is self-esteem? I have found Nathaniel Branden's
        definition to be the most succinct and accurate. He defines self-esteem
        as 'the reputation we acquire with ourselves.' In other words,
        self-esteem is what we think of ourselves. Regardless of what others
        know or think, regardless of what they've seen or not seen, heard or not
        heard, we know everything about ourselves. There is nothing hidden from
        ourselves. Self-esteem is our truth, and it does not matter if anyone
        else knows, because we know, and that is enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        Secondly, why is it important? Because we all know how we act determines
        our life, but fewer of us realize how we think impacts the way we act.
        For example, we act differently around people we love and respect. We
        give them the benefit of the doubt, encourage them, help them, and are
        willing to sacrifice for them. It's not even conscious, but we act with
        love and respect in everything we do around them. In turn, the person
        receiving our positive energy acts like a person worthy of love and
        respect: they don't have to prove anything to anyone. Not through the
        external metrics; like beauty, accomplishments, income or fame. Because
        they know they are enough. Conversely, imagine there is a person you do
        not love or respect. You treat them without consideration, without
        giving respect to their thoughts and desires, feelings, and well-being.
        You do not think they deserve anything good. The person treated without
        love and respect will be inclined to act like they do not deserve love
        or respect. In turn, they will have to find their 'love' and 'respect'
        through external metrics. There is no difference between the person in
        the example and the judgment we pass on ourselves. If we believe
        ourselves to be worthy of love and respect, we will act as such, and
        this will cause others to treat us accordingly. Vice versa, if we do not
        believe ourselves to be worthy of love and respect, we will act in ways
        that signal that, and others will respond accordingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore, self-esteem is important because it determines how we feel on
        a day-to-day basis. It determines the activities we pursue and why we
        pursue them, whether we are excited by a challenge or fearful of
        failure, and whether we give our unique gifts to the world or hide them.
        It determines, when faced with life's ensuing challenges, whether we
        quit or we persevere. In short, self-esteem determines the trajectory of
        our life.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, how do we increase self-esteem? I have found there to be two ways,
        both centered on the same principle: integrity. Simply put, we do what
        we know we should do and don't do what we know we should not do. It does
        not mean always being right but always doing what you know is right. It
        does not mean you cannot make mistakes but means you cannot knowingly
        make a mistake.
      </p>

      <p>
        Firstly, do everything that you know you should be doing. This may
        involve cleaning your room, completing your tasks, having that difficult
        conversation, letting people know your opinions. It may involve making
        that big leap, making that big decision, holding yourself accountable,
        or being honest with yourself. It will be difficult and challenging, and
        you may feel embarrassed or scared. But the more resistance you feel,
        the more important it is to do them. Building self-esteem requires that
        we care more about our values than our reputation. More about our
        actions than what people think. For how can we respect someone,
        especially ourselves, when we know what's good for us but don't do it?
        How can we respect someone who cares more about what others think than
        what they think?
      </p>

      <p>
        Secondly, act as if everything you do is fully visible to the world. If
        you engage in any activity or habit that would embarrass you if done in
        public, make a conscious effort to change that. Either become
        comfortable with the idea of other people witnessing it or avoid doing
        it altogether. Whether it is collecting stamps, liking teddy bears, or
        meditating, be at ease with others observing it. Don't force it on them,
        but don't actively hide it either. Being embarrassed about your actions
        or hobbies signifies that you are rejecting yourself, which is
        detrimental to your self-esteem. Of course, there are exceptions where
        privacy is expected, and we would act differently, but we all know what
        I'm talking about. Never let yourself take actions that you would be
        ashamed of if someone else found out, for that means you are also
        ashamed. Some part of you believes that action or inaction to be
        embarrassing. We must realize that even if no one knows about our
        embarrassment, we know, and that is more than enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, I acknowledge how challenging it is to uphold these
        principles. I struggle with them on a daily basis. However, like all
        worthwhile endeavors in life, it takes time, effort, and persistence.
        But I know that it becomes easier with each passing day. If there is a
        more beautiful way to live life than with courage, persistence, love,
        and honesty, with self-esteem, I have yet to discover it. So start.
        Start small. Take that one step, do that one small thing you know you
        should do. Get up and do it right now.
