            Common and it can be found anywhere in the world. A flower most of us have seen but thought nothing of, we know its name but most can not picture it immediately. Symbolizing simplicity, that is the daisy. Not everyone has qualities that are bold and loud, not everyone sees themselves as significant and extravagant. The simple and common we often discover their significance when we lose them. I would like to link the daisy to our mindset, our ideas of what we have to offer to society. I hope to help untangle your mind and second guess yourself a little less.

            The daisy is tough, it can adapt to almost every environment, it has a large variation of colour and types. Over its course of evolution it has expanded itself to stand its ground in each environment it finds itself, be it a difference in colour or smell. Simple ideas can often bring greater success because it is easy to relate. Remember the yo-yo, someone convinced children all over the world that a bouncy string attached to a ball was a fun thing to play with, I am laughing at myself because I wanted it with all my heart. Have you ever thought how much revenue that simple toy brought to its creator. A success idea does not always need to be over complex; the toy met a need in its season. What you are second guessing maybe a product, a service, a voice that needs to be heard in this season.

            Surprisingly, some species of the daisy can be eaten. This speaks to the versatility of its purpose. One person can think of a product for one reason, another may discover that the same product carries a greater value. The maker of Coca-Cola initially intended it as an alternative to morphine addiction and to threat headaches. Today this is one of the most popular sodas in the world. How many new that the daisy can be eaten, because we look at things a certain way we often miss a hidden benefit to them. You may not know what use your idea may bring, find a second pair of eyes to it, a friend or a stranger you happened to have a conversation with. Every life in this world holds a value, explore like the daisy that has found its place all over the world.

            The charm of simplicity is its ability to unwind complexity, yet retain diversity. Simple things allow for anyone who approaches them to find their own interpretation of its use. Where ever you find the daisy it is in a field of its kind, it makes it home where it lands. To achieve simplicity is to shut out the voice of doubt within yourself, to achieve harmony within yourself.
