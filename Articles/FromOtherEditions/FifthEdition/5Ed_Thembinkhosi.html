          What is your biggest motivation?
        </p>
        <p>
          My biggest motivation is my mother who always influences me to stay positive; also, the feedback and exposure on social media has helped me to keep going.

          What lessons have you learnt in your creative journey? 
        </p>

        <p>
          It is important to gain experience in your field of work before taking big steps as big opportunities will automatically come when you have mastered your skill. Research and drawing inspiration from the likes of Wandile Sihlongonyane has played a huge role in my growth as an artist and most importantly having a fighting spirit. 
        </p>

          What are the overarching challenges that you face producing your work?
        </p>

        <p>
          Art materials are expensive, and the process is time consuming while you have to deal with customers who require discounts and fast delivery 
        </p>

        <div class="article-images">

        <p class="article-start">
          Who continues inspiring you?
        </p>

        <p>
          Uncle Waffles is my inspiration as she has managed to break through the chains of our not so fast entertainment industry and made waves in SA and had her craft appreciated which is what I strive for as well 
        </p>

          What do you do when the customer is dissatisfied?
        </p>

        <p>
          The Artwork is redone as delivering the best is my first priority!
        </p>

        <p class="article-start">
          What would you consider as a big break for you?
        </p>

        <p>
          A big break for me would be getting the opportunity to showcase my artwork at the MTN Bushfire as it will give me great exposure locally and abroad 
        </p>


        <p class="article-start">
          Who else knows about your work? 
        </p>

        <p>
          SA artists and international magazines have given me the platform to showcase my artworks 
        </p>

        <p class="article-start">
          What is your advice to young and upcoming artists?
        </p>

        <p>
          Passion should be the Centre of your craft when one does something they love nothing can stand in their way, everything is possible. Invest in your business get the best material and always stay up to date by researching on techniques and trends in fine art.
