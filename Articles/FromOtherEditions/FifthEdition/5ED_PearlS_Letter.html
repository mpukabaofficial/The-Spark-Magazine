      <h1 class="article-title">A Letter To The You Who Deserves Better</h1>
      <p class="author">By Pearl S.</p>
      <p class="article-date" id="lastEdited"></p>
      <p class="article-start">
        Love, in its many forms is the most powerful thing on earth. You may
        think it is money but people attain all the money in the world and still
        make horrendous decisions because of love. We need to stop being
        dismissive of love, genuine and true love. At the very least, we just
        might need to stop pretending that we do not need it. It matters because
        it is in the absence of love where manipulation and deception thrive.
        Many have never received it from anyone, not parents or friends and
        therefore fall into the hands of predators. As we look to start a new
        chapter in our lives, we owe it to ourselves to be wiser than our former
        selves in life. We owe it to ourselves to not be convinced that we are
        meant to be in places we are not valued.
      </p>

      <p>
        Be careful of people who desire your sole dependency on them. Be careful
        of those who are pleased with you in bondage and never want you to
        experience the liberty of a sound mind. Be careful of manipulation where
        your every opinion is shut down until you believe that your words are
        worth nothing. Be careful of those who shamelessly twist the truth
        before your very eyes. Be careful of those who easily convince you about
        what you like, who you like, who you are regardless of the insistence in
        your heart that, that is not true. Try not to guilted to remain in ugly
        things for other’s sake, a well adjusted you, will be of better help to
        those people. Be careful of people who laugh at your vision for a better
        future. If all these people are unavoidable, distance yourself and
        withdraw their influence from your heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is to you. You deserve dignity and respect. You owe it to yourself
        to grow, to evolve, to understand better. When you speak, you are worth
        being heard, and you owe it to yourself to receive constructive
        correction with grace, in that way you grow. A better life is not beyond
        you because of where you are in life or where you come from. Other
        people’s limitations are not your limitations. Other people’s experience
        will forever be your experience if you never take a step to try things
        for yourself. No one owes you a better life. If you never get up and
        take hold of your life, you will remain a dreamer until the day you die.
        Fear is not your friend. A place that kills your voice, even your inner
        will, is not a place you should be, there are not lessons there, leave.
        The people you perceive to be successful and carefree are hard workers
        behind the scenes where your eyes have no reach. Pray and read the word
        of God. Spend time with the Lord, know Him in the secret place so that
        you recognise His presence in your daily life. I write this last so that
        you remember it first.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can live a better life, get better friends and a better work
        environment.
