        Young and Called: Inside the Spiritual Tabernacle of Ramires!
      </h1>

      <p class="article-start">
        Ever smiling, loving, born leader, visionary, young and commissioned.
        These are some of the words that can be instrumentalized to describe the
        Student Christian Movement chairperson Sisekelo ‘Ramires’ Dlamini. The
        nickname comes after former Chelsea midfield maestro Ramires Do Santos
        Nascimento who became a European champion in 2012. Like Ramires,
        Sisekelo is fierce in his championship of spreading the good news of the
        gospel to the world arena.
      </p>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>
        Sisekelo was raised at Mpolonjeni in Siteki in the Lubombo region, he
        did his primary and High School at ST Philips. He the completed his
        Matric in the republic of South Africa at Bambanani interestingly that
        is where he turned a new leaf and unapologetically received Jesus Christ
        as his saviour. Since then, he has never looked back. In fact, he is a
        living testimony of the scripture which says “remember your creator in
        the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come and the years
        approach when you will say, I find no pleasure in them’’
      </p>

      <h4>SCM Presidency</h4>
      <p>
        Literature stalwart; William Shakespeare once casted a powerful
        statement positing that “some are born great, some achieve greatness,
        some have greatness thrust upon them’’. Shakespeare hands down could
        have been referring to Ramires in all the essences of the statement. His
        spiritual grand enlightenment dawned while he was in his first year at
        University. Through numerous visions, he was shown that one fateful day
        he will become the SCM president. This vision became a reality on his
        third year which shows that God still does communicate with his own.
        During the long- awaited day his predecessor Nkululeko Shongwe when
        doing the much- anticipated handover, he proudly named him ‘JOSHUA’ as
        the chosen one to lead the mighty movement with dignity to the land of
        milk and honey!! what a memorable moment it was. That seemed to be
        prophetic as he was elected the coordinator of UNESWA SCM meaning he is
        the president not just in Kwaluseni but in all three campuses some
        indeed he is the pillar of SCM. Since his takeover the movement has been
        the centre of vibrancy, spiritually reviving concerts like the consuming
        fire musical concert which was a long forgotten SCM concert last hosted
        six years ago but through God and his dedicated committee they brought
        it back to life. What a journey from being Scripture Union’s additional
        member in Grade 12 to become SCM coordinator in Varsity!!
      </p>
      <h4>LOVED BY GOD</h4>

      <p>
        Paul spread the gospel through missionary journeys, Jesus Christ through
        miracles and parables while Remires and his friends spreads the message
        of God’s love through clothing. It goes without any iota of doubt that
        when many people think about the clothing brand ‘LOVED BY GOD’ they
        associate it with Sisekelo , more like those who firmly holds the view
        that Desmond Dube owns Clientele. The similarity of the two is that they
        are both excellent brand ambassadors who put their bodies on the line to
        ensure the success and popularity of the brands that they represent.
        Loved By God is actually owned by his friend Mzwakhe, launched in 2020
        but he has since made it a household brand in the University structures
        and Christian family. I am definitely sure that if a census was to be
        run in UNESWA over 30 % of students dons this brand with outmost love.
        The brand has been selling like hotcakes hence it is now more accurate
        to call it an international brand as it is found in South Africa and
        Mozambique. The aspiration is for the brand to have it’s own stalls and
        not only specialize in spreading awareness of God’s love through
        clothing but through other wings which are going to be revealed soon.

      <h4>WORDS OF WISDOM</h4>

      <p>
        He may not be Steve Harvey but his top-notch advice to the youth is that
        “young people, you are not going to be young forever, you maybe young
        today but you will be old tomorrow, be the next leader of your
        generation, so every decision you make today has a direct implication or
        result of our future. Be careful of the decision you make today as it
        has direct impact on your future. It is wise to make sound decisions
        while still young, youthful and energetic because when you mess up with
        your life right now those scars will remain with you forever. The
        beginning of wisdom is to fear God, if you want to strive in life seek
        wisdom” That is the presidential advice to the youth inspired by God’s
        Love. Ramires further urged those who stay around campus to attend SCM
        services as they protect one from temptations, peer pressure and keep
        your spiritual life in tact.
