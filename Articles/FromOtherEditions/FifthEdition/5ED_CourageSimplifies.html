      <p class="article-start">
        You’ve been walking for five kilometres; you know you don’t like hiking,
        but your friend is right next to you and that means everything is fine.
        You probably could have cycled with the red team, but your friend wanted
        you to walk with her. However, this time around, you were not
        necessarily willing to compromise but the thought of your friends being
        mad at you led you to break-up town. The monsters that haunted you, well
        inside your brain – of course, were too scary for you to wait 8 hours
        until you meet your friend. All this darkness happened within a second
        when she had said the words, “Go with me, it is going to be fun!” That
        is how things usually play out: you always choose to trade in a couple
        of unnecessary hours each day just to keep your friendship. For you,
        every time, it is always a good deal. You are just unsure of how much of
        your soul is left and how much of it are you still willing to give. What
        really is stopping you? Fear, to be precise, it is the lack of courage.
        But isn’t a person supposed to compromise for friendships? Can we really
        do everything that we want to do and keep healthy relationships? Well, I
        am not a relationships expert or close to that but what I do know is
        that one cannot compromise everything. I would assume that a person
        would like to be somewhat in control of their lives. However, this
        article is not about relationships; the idea I would like to draw your
        attention to is courage. For example, in this case, having the galls to
        say no, when the time is right. The valour of doing what you are
        terrified of. I am confident that this ability or skill has the
        potential to simplify everyone’s life giving them more command and a
        voice to what happens in it.

      <h4>Courage can help us maintain our schedule relatively well</h4>
      <p>
        Discipline plays a vital role in following a schedule. People schedule
        in diverse ways: some use technology, whilst others have an estimate on
        their minds of what they should do. In any case, discipline intersects
        with courage in many ways. When some people are alone, they are able to
        go down their to-do list with ease but once you introduce friends and
        family in their environment they hardly cross off any task. They have
        discipline but their discipline is not anchored in courage. Once a
        person develops the courage to use the word “no,” they unlock new
        possibilities in their ability to stick to their schedule. An important
        concept to pay attention to is balance. When our environment changes, we
        need to expect results to change too. The aim is not to pretend that the
        company you now have does not exist; you are going to cross off less
        tasks in your to-do because you might have to spend time with your
        friends and family. The point here is to say yes to things that you find
        important in any standard you choose to use and also say no when you
        realize that nothing is getting done. That middle ground will keep your
        relationships healthier and your schedule healthy too. You have the
        power to influence your schedule when you courageously and consciously
        make decisions that work with what you want to achieve – simplifying
        your life.
      </p>

      <h4>Courage can help us navigate our relationships</h4>

      <p>
        Courage plays and significant role in relationships and our
        participation in them. I have always thought that people who are the
        infamous “yes mans” have an edge on relationship. Who wouldn’t like to
        have a person who conforms to whatever standard they set? It turns out
        that relationships are more complicated than that. There are still
        rumours that people like those who treat them badly; also, it is way
        complicated than that. There is no right answer to all these theories
        because they all have some merit to them. Some people have witnessed at
        some point their theory playout right in front of their eyes and they
        have a valid reason to assume that it is true. At the same time, there
        are errors in our perception because a person may have simplified an
        event they saw. Still, I am trying to show that there are no definitive
        rules to relationships. “Then if there aren’t rules to relationships how
        does courage make a difference?” one may ask. The idea of courage in
        relationships is intentional participation. Every person should, at bare
        minimum, actively participate in their relationships. It could mean that
        a person will tell the truth when they lose feelings for their partner;
        it could mean that it is time they confront that person who keeps on
        subduing or undermining them in a relationship; it could mean making a
        move on the special someone without having to spend months wondering if
        they like you back; it could definitely mean that you can say “no” if
        one does not want to do something. I know this is me projecting some of
        the things I have faced or are facing but I have also seen people fail
        to muster the courage to do what they should do. This ultimately leads
        to authenticity, which is a valuable trait in relationships. When we
        possess the power to pursue any option we desire, our choices become a
        genuine expression of our character. Unfettered by constraints, our
        selection reflects our true interests and passions. Thus, we embody
        authenticity through our unrestricted decision-making. If we unleash the
        trait of gallantry, we can be able to not regret “allowing” things to
        happen, but we will take responsibility of what the outcome of the
        relationship becomes.
      </p>

      <h4>The only pain we will endure is courage</h4>

      <p>
        Courage is painful and it defeats the human ambition for millions of
        years which is fear, but it is less painful than the opposite. Humans
        have used fear to drive them into dominating the world and that has been
        a remarkable success. In my opinion, in intra-relations of humans, fear
        is the worst tool to use. We are no longer threatened and in order for
        us to thrive, we should strive to be courageous. Beyond that courage is
        necessary because the pain induced in our minds by being a coward is
        relatively worse than the act of being courageous. This is definitely an
        opinion that I have: spinelessness always hurts my morale. Giving in
        when the time to execute is the worst strategy. It is shooting oneself
        in the foot. People do not act cowardly because they do not realize the
        importance of courage, but it is their means to be safe. Searching for
        comfort is a big deal for some people because they have been hurt by
        acts of courage. They may have lost friends and accumulated trauma.
        However, the consequence of allowing fear to run your life is losing
        choice. You will not be able to choose your job, your friends, you will
        not choose the size of you food, you will not choose the lifestyle you
        want. Worry torments the gutless – leading to a common result: regret!
        Regret is the hell space of the mind. It is not fun; it is you fighting
        against yourself. And the most dangerous thing to you, is yourself.
        Choosing to be courageous will enable you to endure the lesser hell. We
        cannot avoid the pain, but we can choose to be courageous.
      </p>

      <h4>Courage paves the path to our purpose</h4>

      <p>
        “If you had no fear, absolutely no fear what would you be doing right
        now? Is what you are doing a consequence of fear or choice?” I do not
        like the phrasing of these questions, but they do bring up important
        thoughts to anyone trying to respond to them. A better phrasing could
        be, “If you were more courageous, what would you be doing right now?”
        With this phrasing we realize that the aim is not to have no fear but to
        have courage to overcome the fears we already have. It gives the
        antidote to fear – in this case courage – which is more attainable than
        the absence of fear. We get held back if we do not have the courage to
        change our situations. One of the reasons we are held back is because of
        the way our society is structured, those who take bold moves are more
        likely to be punished to a point where they need to scramble even for
        their survival. Many, also, have done incredible things because they had
        the courage to pursue their greatest ambitions knowing the consequences.
        Pursuing our dreams is not only in large scale such as becoming an
        artist, but it is the daily tasks, we choose despite the potential
        consequences of making those decisions. Drawing from the introduction,
        where you do not say no to your friend because you are afraid of losing
        them. Our abilities to choose what we want is greatly reduced, and our
        ability to fulfil our goals is inexistent without courage. We need to be
        responsible for our choices but sometimes for things to change, drastic
        and reckless actions are necessary. If one really finds their purpose
        important, they might as well use courage to pave their way. The choices
        becomes simple. It no longer becomes a decision of whether or not will
        they do it but them doing it is inevitable. They must!
      </p>

      <h4>Courage: choice over fear</h4>

      <p>
        A running hypothesis I have is that fear is an antonym of choice. This
        is a hypothesis because I know it breaks down in some instances.
        However, it is true in a lot of other instances. Many people have been
        to school and sometimes the teacher says something they do not
        understand. It is always their right to ask for clarification. Guess how
        many people, because of timidity, decide not to ask for clarification? I
        say decide but we know they are too scared to ask. That particular
        decision is by default, it is consequential. There is absolutely nothing
        they can do about it. Nothing. If you begin to think about it, that is
        very – what is this word – sad! This does not happen only in their life;
        millions participate in this game. And the question always is: why? Why
        wouldn’t they want to know? Past that, the fact is they do not have the
        choice. “Fate” if I may, chooses for them and chooses the worst viable
        option for them. This results, as we have discussed above, to a hell
        space. If this does not motivate you to be more courageous this means
        that your terror runs deep. You might already be terrified by the
        thought of being courageous. However, the good news is everyone can
        become courageous. Everyone! It is not going to be easy, and it will be
        nerve-wracking at times but it sure will help us regain our choice – our
        freedom. That freedom will simplify our lives because we can mould our
        lives in any and every way we want to. Courage simplifies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Think about it, there are so many cool things in your mind that you
        haven’t done because you did not have the guts to do them. You probably
        have a world of possibilities in your head, but your choices are leashed
        by fear. You may have complicated your life with the lack of decision;
        furthermore, you do not decide because you are afraid of the
        repercussions that result from the decision. In contrast, your inability
        to decided may not be because of you fearing the consequences of the
        choice, but it could be that you have been stripped off your freedom to
        decide by fear – just because. Spinelessness is not always rational. A
        breakthrough awaits you on the other side of fear. We aren’t trying to
        end fear, but we want to see ourselves triumph over fear without
        hesitation and with intention. It could be you today.
