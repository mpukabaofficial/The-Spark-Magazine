        The Age Of AI: Going Beneath The Skin Of The Phenomenon Of AI
      </h1>
      <p class="author">By Mphumelelo Khaba</p>
      <p class="article-date" id="lastEdited"></p>
      <p class="article-start">
        As someone who has lived both in and out of eSwatini, I've noticed a
        peculiar mindset: we often believe we know enough about the world. This
        complacency in knowledge is risky, especially in fields like Artificial
        Intelligence (AI), where new developments are constantly overturning old
        understandings. We have geniuses like Albert Einstein saying the
        following, “The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know.”
        It makes me wonder why we are so comfortable in our knowledge and why we
        aren’t as curious and sceptical of our knowledge. I am not here to talk
        about that, but I believe it would be an interesting study. In our
        partial ignorance, and me being a tech enthusiast, I believe I have to
        share some of the developments in technology such as AI. Which in long
        form is called Artificial Intelligence. I would like to share some of
        the basics of it and share some of my thoughts in the subject and how it
        can improve us, as a country and also threaten our ability to improve
        too.
      </p>

      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence can be described as the ability for a computer
        or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks associated with an
        intelligent being, in this case humans. AI has been in development for
        years and now has made major breakthroughs that is why it is a trending
        topic. The earliest known attempt to develop these technologies is in
        the 1950s to 1970s in the form of Neural Networks. Neural Networks are a
        set of instructions that take in a input, analyse and give out an
        output. But this technology, as a standalone, had some difficulties
        performing advanced tasks because it demanded a lot of functions to be
        written in order to advance it. This paved the way for Machine Learning.
        The idea was to teach a machine how to learn, feed it with large amounts
        of data, allow the machine to analyse it, learn the data and derive
        complex models that we also do not know. Once enough data has been fed
        we test if the machine is able to produce accurate results during
        testing. Machine learning happened between 1980s and 2010s. Deep
        learning emerged in 2011 to 2023s, which essentially uses neural
        networks to process large amounts of data. In the present day, we are
        using Generative AI which does the opposite of Machine Learning after
        being trained; Generative AI goes beyond predicting data after training
        but it produces new data as its output, for example, images. Note that
        these technologies are used simultaneously to produce the large and
        complex systems that exist today.

      </div>

      <p>
        Why though? Why is it important? It does the repetitive computerized
        tasks reliably without fatigue, that frees up time for people to focus
        on high level tasks and thinking. It has also improved a lot of existing
        technologies such as spelling checks. Due to it being trained with large
        amounts of data, it is able to find patterns in complex structures. AI
        is one of the few technologies where you can have very large amounts of
        data in one place and it is able to analyse more and deeper data. It is
        able to learn better and improve, meaning it is becoming more and more
        accurate. In a nutshell it is taking human abilities to the next level.
      </p>

      <p>
        The future of AI is as exciting as it is uncertain. It could lead to
        groundbreaking medical discoveries or revolutionize how we interact with
        technology. However, it could also bring challenges we haven't yet
        anticipated. As AI becomes increasingly sophisticated, the conversation
        around its development and use must also evolve.

        /></a>
      </div>

      <p>
        In eSwatini and around the world, AI is not just a technological marvel
        but a catalyst for societal change. Understanding AI is the first step
        towards harnessing its potential for good while mitigating its risks. As
        we navigate this new age of AI, let's approach it with curiosity,
        caution, and a willingness to learn and adapt.
