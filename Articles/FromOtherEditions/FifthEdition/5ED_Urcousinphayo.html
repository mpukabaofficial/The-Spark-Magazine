        From the moment we are born, we begin to dream. Some dreams change with
        time, while others remain a constant. But for all of us, there are those
        dreams that speak to our very soul - the ones we know we must pursue, no
        matter what obstacles may stand in our way. While not all of us are
        given the chance to see our dreams realized, those who do experience a
        sense of fulfillment unlike any other.

        Nkosephayo Ntokozo Mndzebele, born and raised in Swaziland, is making
        waves in multiple industries. From his early years in Manzini,
        Swaziland, to pursuing his education in Schoemansdal, Mpumalanga,
        Nkosephayo's journey has been one of determination and passion. After
        completing his high school education, he went on to obtain a Law degree
        from Nelson Mandela University in Gqeberha (formerly known as Port
        Elizabeth).Throughout his journey, Nkosephayo's biggest supporter has
        been his mother. With unwavering love and belief in her son, she has
        carried him through challenging situations. Initially, she struggled to
        understand his passion for deejaying, but she eventually warmed up to
        it, asking about his gigs and expressing immense excitement when he
        appeared in newspapers.
      </p>
      <div class="article-images">

          href="/images/FifthEdition/YoungPeopleOnTheMove/Urcousinphayo/5ED_Urcousinphayo_green.jpg"

      <p>
        As a DJ, Nkosephayo faced the challenge of building his name and gaining
        recognition in the competitive entertainment industry. Understanding the
        importance of relevance in securing bookings, he tirelessly worked
        towards establishing himself. To balance his professional life as a DJ
        and entrepreneur, he carefully allocates time between his DJing gigs,
        which predominantly happen during weekends and nights, and his business
        ventures, which operate during regular working hours. Nkosephayo's stage
        name, URCOUSINPHAYO, symbolizes the close connection he feels with his
        listeners and supporters. He considers them as his extended family and
        proudly embraces the nickname "Mzala we Khantri." Rather than viewing
        them as fans, Nkosephayo values the sense of community and belonging
        that comes with a shared love for music.
      </p>

      <p>
        His love for music developed from a young age, as he fondly recalls his
        first experience with music through a mini radio that played cassettes.
        He and his family would charge the batteries with solar power so they
        could enjoy listening to shows like "Talabasha netabo" on EBIS 1 radio.
        This early exposure to the enchanting sounds of music ignited
        Nkosephayo's passion for becoming a DJ.While talent and skills are
        crucial for success as a DJ, Nkosephayo emphasizes the significance of
        positioning oneself for opportunities through effective marketing.
        Utilizing social media and the internet, he has harnessed the power of
        self-promotion, gaining bookings even in locations where he hasn't
        physically performed. The accessibility provided by social media has
        proven to be a game-changer for his career.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an afro house DJ, Nkosephayo actively follows various afro house
        producers and pages to stay updated on exclusive content. Moreover, his
        friendships with these producers enable him to receive new songs for
        testing purposes. This collaboration benefits both parties and
        contributes to the diversification of his sound. Nkosephayo rarely
        experiences performance anxiety, but when he does, he relies on his
        support structure to remind him of his talent and abilities. To overcome
        creative blocks, he explores different genres, occasionally finding
        inspiration from amapiano or vocal elements to infuse into his preferred
        genres of afro house and afro tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though mindful of industry politics, Nkosephayo chooses to ignore them,
        focusing instead on his work and avoiding unnecessary stress. He
        acknowledges that the industry's dynamics can indirectly affect him as
        an artist, but he remains committed to his craft and keeps his focus on
        making great music. The most rewarding aspect of being a DJ for
        Nkosephayo is witnessing the joy on people's faces when his song
        selection resonates with them. He believes that experiencing someone
        moved to tears by a song signifies the true impact of being a DJ.
        Additionally, traveling to various venues nationwide has exposed him to
        places he never knew existed, enriching his cultural experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nkosephayo's talent and hard work have not gone unnoticed. In 2022, he
        was a top 5 finalist in the popular DJ category at the Social Media
        Awards hosted by Swazi Boy TV. With confidence and determination, he
        aims to surpass his achievements this year. Recent performances
        alongside renowned artists such as Kwesta, Maglera doe boy, Blxckie, Da
        Capo, and Sun El Musician have further solidified Nkosephayo's presence
        in the industry. Such opportunities have allowed him to showcase his
        skills while collaborating with established names.Looking ahead,
        Nkosephayo aspires to share the stage with Morda, admiring his unique
        playing style and his new sound since his departure from Black Motion.
        He is also eager to perform in the Netherlands and Spain, where the love
        for house music is vibrant.

        talents as a DJ, lawyer, and entrepreneur. His journey exemplifies the
        possibilities that arise when passion and dedication converge, serving
        as an inspiration to aspiring artists in the entertainment industry.

      <h4>SKOON DRIP: Revolutionizing Fashion with Unique Style</h4>
      <p>
        When it comes to the fashion industry, Nkosephayo’s creativity and
        entrepreneurial spirit shines through his unique clothing brand, SKOON
        DRIP. Born from his passion for fashion and the desire to create
        garments that stood out from the rest, SKOON DRIP is making waves in the
        industry, slowly but steadily. Nkosephayo's journey began with his
        previous clothing brand, Since Van Tuka (SVT). However, he soon
        discovered that the name was widely used by other clothing brands,
        leading to a lack of exclusivity. That's when he made the decision to
        close SVT and give birth to SKOON DRIP, striving to create a clean and
        minimalistic brand.
      </p>

      <p>
        The name SKOON DRIP reflects the brand's vision and aesthetic. "SKOON"
        is an Afrikaans term that epitomizes cleanliness, purity, and undiluted
        style, while "DRIP" is a slang word synonymous with swag and fashion.
        This combination perfectly encapsulates the brand's intention to create
        sleek and minimalistic designs, evident in their new logo. SKOON DRIP
        products often feature small print logos, maintaining the brand's clean
        and sophisticated look. Unlike some competitors who rely on buying
        pre-made garments and branding them, SKOON DRIP stands out by creating
        its own garments from carefully selected high-quality materials. The
        brand's emphasis on detail ensures a perfect finish, resonating strongly
        with their clients' taste and preferences.

        /></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        Among their range, the RARE line has become a customer favorite,
        especially their sweaters. These exclusive designs caught people's
        attention with their uniquely placed prints and top-notch material
        quality. The SKOON DRIP OG tee is also highly popular, offering
        simplicity with a strong fashion statement. Staying true to their ethos,
        SKOON DRIP paves its own path and doesn't try to follow trends or
        compete with other brands. By moving at their own pace and maintaining
        their unique style, they have established themselves as one of the top
        brands in Eswatini, even two years after their inception.
      </p>
      <p>
        The experience of running SKOON DRIP has been nothing short of amazing
        for Nkosephayo. Personally delivering the products allows him to see the
        joy on customers' faces in real-time and hear their valuable feedback.
        This feedback helps the brand grow and ensures they consistently offer
        the best products. Looking ahead, Nkosephayo envisions SKOON DRIP
        becoming the number one brand in Swaziland within the next two years.
        The team is currently working behind the scenes to launch a commercial
        website, providing customers with the convenience of ordering their
        favorite SKOON DRIP products directly to their doorstep or a nearby
        town. In the next five years, or even sooner, SKOON DRIP aims to open
        its own flagship store, offering customers a memorable shopping
        experience with unparalleled quality and exceptional customer service.

      </div>
      <p>
        When it comes to inspiration, Nkosephayo draws from his own life
        experiences and his unique perspective of the world. The RARE edition,
        for example, serves as a reminder to individuals that they are rare gems
        who should embrace their true selves. Nkosephayo wants to encourage his
        clients to be authentic and unique, because there is only one of them.In
        terms of other clothing brands that he admires, GALXBOY and FEAR OF GOD
        top Nkosephayo's list. However, it is football legend Teko Modise who
        inspires him most in the realm of fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
        SKOON DRIP's innovative approach to fashion presents a refreshing take
        on style and individuality. With Nkosephayo's determination and
        creativity at the helm, SKOON DRIP is poised for continued growth and
        success, captivating fashion lovers with their one-of-a-kind designs.
