        Vision 2022: The Story Of a Country Killing its Dreams.|Part 1
      </h1>

      <p class="article-start">
        I was leaving for 2 years and I thought all things were going to be on
        track and nothing would deter eSwatini from its course. I couldn’t
        postulate a tragic event that could make a sweeping difference in the
        land of the Swazi people, eSwatini. After running many scenarios in my
        head, I was not able to foresee a disease, in this case COVID-19, that
        would make a grand entrance and take the reins from humanity. However,
        for me that wasn’t the worst part in those two years. After those two
        years I had to return. I landed at the airport and I was very excited by
        the thought that I was going to drive and witness the rapidly emerging
        urban areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The airport was so secluded it makes one think there couldn’t be a
        developed area in that particular country. But it was not just a
        particular country it was my home for nineteen years – I knew it like
        the back of my hand. Not because I am equating the size of my hand to
        the size of my country or vice versa, although it is a relatively small
        country. I knew that as I would have been driving, eventually, I would
        enter civilization; and, at that moment, I was hypnotized anticipating
        how much it had developed.
      </p>

      <div class="quote light quote-color-grey">
        <p>"The slogans always gave me hope: “Vision 2022!” "</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        My disappointment stems from the events that preceded me leaving
        eSwatini. There were ever so repeating slogans on the radio in the
        mornings as I rode the bus to school. EmaSwati know this as Quantum or
        Kombi. If it weren’t for my everyday morning commutes, I never would
        have listened to the radio otherwise. I am glad I did because I got to
        be inspired and my favourite part were the slogans. The slogans always
        gave me hope: “Vision 2022!” I held on to that promise and told myself
        that one day I will be riding a Quantum and there will be tall buildings
        all over the place and the Swazi people would be flourishing left and
        right. The harvest of our work – or maybe the king’s , as others
        speculated – would have been bountiful. I thought maybe, just maybe, the
        dream would be attained. I wanted that. I was rooting for that. That
        thought parallels the ride from the airport back home. On the way home
        my cheeks could not stop visiting my ears as I saw the roads being built
        and massive improvement was occurring.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, I was not fully satisfied with how fast the progress was being
        made. In all the excitement and the motivation, a part of me was being
        contaminated with the pessimistic thought that we might be too slow.
        Actually, very, very slow. To explain how impactful this tiny negative
        feeling was, imagine my happiness being drinking water in a 20-litre
        bucket. The cynicism is like a drop of poison added to that water –
        probably it would not injure a person who drinks it but the stakes are
        just too high. Neither could I stay excited! Probably the wave of
        advancement was on its way and so I asked questions. I was constantly
        asking the wrong ones until it came to me: “Why wouldn’t I just ask
        about the 2022 vision?”
      </p>

      <div class="quote quote-color-light-brown dark">
        <p>
          "I was constantly asking the wrong ones until it came to me: “Why
          wouldn’t I just ask about the 2022 vision?” "
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        I wish I never asked that. It was a big mistake. “Wait what? 2022 is
        gone?” that was me thinking it was a joke, a bad one I might add. If it
        were for me, such a joke should be illegalized, people should not be
        allowed to make a joke about the vision 2022. Especially if they say
        that it is dead. It was sacred to my heart. To my surprise, it wasn’t a
        joke. I felt like the country waited for me to leave and it just tossed
        the vision into the abyss and moved on. Why me though? Eswatini had
        killed its dream to become a developed country by year 2022. I was only
        gone for two years and returned in 2021. Those were the worst news I had
        received by that time.
      </p>

      <p>
        What bugged me is not whether we could or we could not reach it. Even if
        after the deadline, we would have made it one percent of the way. I
        would be okay about it. What I could not wrap my mind around was the
        idea that an entire country could conveniently let go of a dream without
        fighting. They raised the white flag before they failed and mindlessly
        felt good about it. They thought by quitting earlier they would avoid
        failing and I hope you also realize the irony in that. Quitting
        guaranteed the failure inevitable but we should not have done that. We
        should have tried and failed. We should have been willing to endure the
        embarrassment of failing hard.
      </p>

      <div class="quote quote-color-navy-blue dark">

          "We should have tried and failed. We should have been willing to
          endure the embarrassment of failing hard"
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        There is something sinister about a whole society willing to put away a
        dream and its ambitions. It clearly shows the extent at which each
        individual, liSwati, is aspirational. For me it screamed that the
        statistics were: “… over 50% of emaSwati are willing to quit…” I hope I
        am completely wrong. I hope I am way off track, I hope that my logic is
        absurd and the fact is that I am crazy to even come up with this
        conclusion. If I am right, disaster! This kind of mindset brews terror
        in my mind because I hope emaSwati would have some love for the country.
        Just a little bit. I wish the people of eSwatini could have a Spark of
        love for eSwatini in their heart. I think ownership and the feeling of
        responsibility of making the eSwatini, my home, better than yesterday
        has a promise of great rewards.
