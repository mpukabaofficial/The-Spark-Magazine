      <p class="article-start">
        Why are you reading part 3, the finale, of the Vision 2022 trilogy? I
        thought I was outrageous enough on the first two parts hoping no one
        reads this one. My thoughts were: “I am going to make the pores so small
        that they filter out most readers.” Especially, I had the guts, and I
        still do, to proclaim a new vision for eSwatini. I thought it would be
        easy for everyone to think, “Okay, that’s it!” As a consequence,
        disappearing in their caves because it is just a dream and eSwatini can
        never amount to anything.
      </p>

      <div class="quote quote-color-green dark">
        <p>
          "Especially, I had the guts, and I still do, to proclaim a new vision
          for eSwatini. "
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        However, I am sure you are going to be glad that you have read this part
        because the mindset I am encouraging emaSwati to start having is
        completely vital in any pursuit of excellence. Truth be told, I know I
        am not an authority figure in eSwatini in any way. The problem is, I was
        waiting for someone within our leadership to say something to challenge
        and encourage us, as a nation, to pursue the greater good for our
        country. I became too impatient because I value time and I can never
        agree to wasting it. But what did I mean really when I said, “Vision
        eSwatini”, and what is expected of emaSwati? I meant let us play with
        our own rules and utilize our strengths in ensuring that we are the best
        that we can be.
      </p>

      <p>
        My assumptions when I was told eSwatini would be a developed country by
        2022 were distorted, immature, and stereotypical. For me, nothing meant
        “first world” than an impossibly tall skyscraper. A marvel that everyone
        was going to see when they realized they could not see its pinnacle. It
        meant a fully technological operated society, basically a utopia. It
        meant everything that America is, and to have all that was absolute
        bliss! The more I think about it, I realize that I was just hooked on a
        fantasy and forgot the real world - some call it detachment from
        reality. I am positive that their description is precise. I think the
        fuss that I have about the 2022 dream being cast off is rooted in my
        selfishness and unhealthy fantasy of how things could be. Or maybe
        that’s not the case, perhaps I see more. Ignoring the lenses I use to
        make my judgements and using the ones most people use is not the path I
        choose to take. This is because my perception of the world, eSwatini
        being my world, is slowly evolving, and, as I grow, I know that I must
        share what I see with everyone.

        Let me explain what I mean. Two lab experts are examining the contents
        of blood of a sick person. By merely looking at the blood, also against
        the blood of a healthy person, everything appears normal. Then what
        could the problem be? For all they know, it’s just an inherent disease
        and the patient can never be cured. The blood is similar to one of a
        healthy person and anyone who stares at it agrees. To be thorough, they
        then decide to inspect every component of the person’s body, still with
        their naked eyes, everything seems standard, but what is wrong? One of
        the experts decides to use a microscope. The other says, “No, that is
        not how we should look at things. The only way to look at things is
        through our natural lenses [- our eyes]!” Whilst the expert is still
        convincing the one using a microscope, the one on the microscope yells,
        “I see something different!” They both take turns observing the tiny
        microorganisms present in the “sick blood” but not in the “healthy
        blood.” Their use of a microscope has opened new doors of perception. I
        am a firm believer of the idea that people have different world views. I
        am not implying that we have different realities but there are different
        lenses that people use to see the world. I have different lenses, with
        which I see eSwatini, than a person who does not recognize eSwatini as
        full of potential. I no longer see the fantastical tall buildings and
        America-like eSwatini. I lied, I do sometimes – twice on Sunday. Even if
        that is so, my perception has changed due to my exposure to places
        beyond eSwatini and uncommon ideas that I have learnt – whether right or
        wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        Probably the issues we are facing today in the country are symptoms of
        deeper problems. Taking a bottom up approach, I would say that the
        little things we are doing daily are holding us back as a country. There
        is a saying, “A chain is as strong as its weakest link.” If as emaSwati
        we hope to have a better economy, competent politicians, a cleaner
        environment and a healthy society, it is fair to also evaluate how
        individuals are doing in these areas. We cannot expect to build a strong
        economy if its people are only partaking in reckless spending instead of
        investing and saving. We cannot expect to have good leaders from a
        population that treat their lovers badly and a population that oppresses
        women and brutally treats other people. We, also, cannot expect a clean
        country if we carelessly litter all around our beautiful land, and make
        no effort in making our homes look good. Obviously, those issues are not
        fixed overnight and that is why we need full participation. As we
        address the bigger problems, let us keep the integrity we want to see
        the country move towards in our personal lives too. By doing so we can
        reduce the obstacles right in front of us. We can also realize our
        capabilities and the possibilities that await eSwatini if we take part
        in the journey of becoming a better country.
      </p>

        Learning from a lot of European countries, tall buildings are not the
        center of their status. Some countries such a Switzerland celebrate
        nature, the same nature eSwatini has! Some have strong cultures, just
        like we do! I strongly believe that at the core of everything is the
        confidence in themselves as people and their abilities. The ability to
        treat each other better; the ability for them to keep their lawns clean
        and beautiful; the ability to enjoy what they have. There evidently are
        more reasons developed countries are where they are today. They aren’t
        here because they thought everyone would laugh at them if one started
        picking litter at their nearest grocery store for free. There are more
        humble and attainable ways to encroach towards first world status.

        />
      </div>

      <p>
        There are many levels that each and every one of us can participate in
        making eSwatini better. We can have a dream but if we aren’t fired up to
        achieve it, we might as well throw it away and seal our fate. Practical
        steps an individual can take include the following: offer high quality
        service if you are a waiter, read – we need more educated and
        open-minded people, adopt a park to clean and take care of it, volunteer
        in a non-profit, and many more. For groups, start a business, actively
        work on your relationships, start a magazine, or create a donation app.
        These are random ideas that I had in my mind whilst typing but I think
        any of that would make eSwatini a little bit better and we will be on a
        highway to a better future. Just like the two lab experts, the tiny
        organisms were what differentiated the blood of a sick person and a
        healthy person. Remember, by also tackling some of the small issues we
        will have a healthy country that will no longer be limited by infection.
