            I have a dream, it is to see Africa rise and stand on par with nations we view as global superpowers. I dream to see the youth manifesting the fruits of their hopes and dreams. I believe it would be hypocritical to my dream to never once mention this, ‘ effort and hard work even intelligence are great but they are not enough nor are they the key ingredient to success’. There are mysteries in this world that make it move, there are principles that govern life, the wise say life is Spiritual. One of these principles is that what you come to obtain in life is a result of what you believe. This is my belief, I am simply sharing it, it is to your discretion to consider it or to dismiss it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider all that you have dreamt to be, to have, to be surrounded by , the thing you got to have is what you believed you could have. If you received what you never thought you could have, then certainly there is a step outside of normal that you took and got a new result. When I look at some of the Western and Asian nations global status aside, there are things they grow up believing about themselves because of the society they grow up in, a certain worth they assign to themselves. They invent the weirdest things and become wealthy, they leave their homes and occupy other nations, open business and succeed. It is a confidence not without anxiety, that “ I will take this step and the only option is to succeed”. Something that may not be obvious to them has been introduced into their frame of thinking which fosters their success.  
        </p>


        <p>
            When you decide to step in your dream, each step of the way seat down and answer this truthfully to yourself, ‘Will I make it?’. This question is about if you actually see yourself reaping the fruits of your effort, do you see yourself a part of your own dream. To envision is the first step, even business plans are required to have a vision and a mission, how much more your dreams. Spending time with elders has taught me something, some of the dreams they had for themselves they did not see themselves in them and therefore projected them to others or their children. What made them decide that it was not possible for them to enter into their own dreams. This reminds me of the story about the elephant.
        </p>

        <p>
            A man was walking through an elephant camp, and he saw that the elephants were not being kept in cages. All that was holding them back from escaping the camp, was a small piece of rope tied to one of their legs. The man saw this and wondered to himself, why the elephants did not just use their strength to break the rope and escape the camp. They could easily have done so, but instead, remained where they were.
        </p>

              "I believe it would be hypocritical to my dream to never once mention this, ‘ effort and hard work even intelligence are great but they are not enough nor are they the key ingredient to success’. "
            </p>
          </div>


        <p>
            Curious to know the answer, the man asked a trainer nearby why the elephants were just standing there and never tried to escape.
        </p>

        <p>
            The trainer replied: “When they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free."

            You can be conditioned by society that your skin colour, your gender, status, disability, personality resembles those who do not become successful in life. There are jobs said to be for man and not for women or vice versa, there are dreams we are not allowed to have because no black person has ever achieved it, or that no one without certain connections can have a certain level of success in an industry. Who said only woman can be an air hostess, who told you that your business idea can not work in this country, who has limited your path the most. This conditioning is something normal to you,  like the elephant, an ingrained belief system in your minds that it does not occur to you that you are carrying the rope tied to your own neck.

            Today I come with a challenge of self introspection. There are people who could rise above though born into poverty, above their illiteracy, lack resources or family background.
