        Finding a good explanation that could suffice to justify why this
        magazine is integral in bringing back all lost hope in the Swazi nation
        in rebuilding and making eSwatini a better country for all, has not been
        an easy task. This is due to the fact that, to most emaSwati, eSwatini
        becoming a free country where the people are liberated from all the
        social, political and economic problems has become nothing more than
        just a dream that has and will never see the light of day. Over the
        years, all hopes and dreams of our people have been shattered and
        reduced to nothing but just that; hopes and dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
        People are struggling and are barely coping to make ends meet. People
        are crying blood. Eswatini is and has remained a low-income country
        because of many reasons which include; politics, diseases, illiteracy,
        greed, ignorance and last but not least: the mindset that was cultivated
        in the nation in yesteryears. This has added fuel to the fire in being
        some of the factors that are pushing and pulling fellow emaSwati out of
        this struggling country. It has come to the point where the only
        solution most emaSwati have, especially the youth, is to look for
        greener pastures in neighboring countries.

      <p>
        The assumption is, things are better on the other side and I must admit,
        just like the saying goes; the grass is greener for them on the other
        side! But as I wrap my mind around this, I find no peace. It triggers
        serious uncertainties about this solution. Is the grass really greener
        for foreigners living in a foreign country which has built its economy
        for its people by the people? If yes, for how long? And for how many
        foreigners? Truth is, the resources of a foreign country would never be
        enough for all foreigners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if that could be a reality, the native people of that particular
        country would not entirely open up to this which would then incite
        violence and unrest like xenophobia in the long run. Now, is it really
        wise to leave our native land, land that our forefathers fought for,
        that still has massive potential to grow for one that is not ours? Are
        we really not capable of finding sustainable ways of making it
        productive and a conducive space to live in? The justification of the
        necessity of this magazine lies on, but not limited, to the realization
        of the answers of these highlighted questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not to imply that emaSwati are dumb and deserve the poverty and
        disadvantaged economy they currently live under, but it is to enlighten
        and emphasize the note that eSwatini could do so much better if we as a
        people would have an open-minded approach in solving the problems at
        hand than opting for the easy way out, which is giving up. All we need
        is a little spark of love towards the country and its future. It is that
        spark of love that will then drive us all into the right channels which
        will help emancipate the Swazi nation from all the bondages that are
        holding us back in making our hopes and dreams in this land a reality.

      <h3>The bigger picture</h3>
      <p>
        Everyone should be aware that the magazine is not the end goal but a
        beginning of an ongoing investigation that asks two important questions:
        what is there to love about eSwatini and how can we collectively build
        it into being the country we desperately desire it to be? Yes they sound
        like utopian inquiries, but they are what we need to challenge ourselves
        in taking the necessary steps towards making a difference. Politics, the
        economy and other factors may be limiting factors for us but we are a
        more than capable youth.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are born in the most creative, constructive, technological and
        innovative times in history. We have the immaculate power of education.
        We should take advantage of that in whirling the winds of change to the
        direction we want our precious country to be.
      </p>

          src="/images/eswatini-stamp.webp"
          alt="A picture of a stamp with a Swazi Flag"
          class="cover-image"
        />
      </div>

      <h3>What is this?</h3>
      <p>
        The magazine is a platform and catalogue for the youth to be inspired,
        to showcase our heroes who are working effortlessly in the backgrounds
        and forefront in making our beloved eSwatini a better place for all. It
        is the voice for the voiceless. It is a platform where people are given
        a chance to confidently lay out their souls to fellow emaSwati and the
        world at large. It is there to reconstruct and unleash the real beauty
        of this country. It is an empowering vehicle that aims to empower and
        replenish the lost hope in the entire Swazi nation.
      </p>

      <p>
        It will entail interesting thoughts, mind boggling facts and
        opportunities for people to get up from their couches and not so
        comfortable "comfort" zones and actually do something in making our
        dreams a reality!
      </p>

      <h3>Last words</h3>

      <p>
        I may not know for sure when exactly this great change will come to
        pass, but I know for sure that change is inevitable! The winds of change
        are blowing already. It is up to us as a nation to unite and soldier on
        in freeing ourselves from ignorance and deprivation. All I am asking is
        for us to change our mindset towards the challenges we are faced with as
        a nation. I challenge us, the Swazi youth, to put it on ourselves to win
        this attack on our precious land. To break the insidious cycle of
        inadequacy and deprivation. Each one of us has to take some
        responsibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each one of us has to do some introspection and have a conversation with
        oneself as to what attempts can one do to shape and create the eSwatini
        generations have been yearning for. No effort is too little at this
        point. Individualism is not an African trait hence it has destroyed our
        precious land. We need to stand up as eSwatini and fight for our land,
        for our rights. If we really need those jobs, high level education,
        lucrative income, freedom of expression amongst other things, we need
        not to run away. There is more for each one of us here at home. We must
        stay and fight. It is possible, only if we work in solidarity. Now is
        the time!
      </p>
