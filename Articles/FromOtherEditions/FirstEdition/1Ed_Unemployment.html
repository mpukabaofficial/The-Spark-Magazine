      <h1 class="article-title">Unemployment: the story of Hope</h1>
      <p class="article-date">Last edited: July 14, 2022</p>
      <p class="article-start">
        It is no secret that the employment rate is very low in eSwatini. One
        would expect that this high rate of unemployment is a result of
        illiteracy or lack of skill amongst other things but that is not the
        case since even graduates are sitting at home with their qualifications.
        The huge problem is limited job opportunities in this country. Evidence
        has shown that stagnant economic growth has been unable to provide the
        necessary job opportunities thus resulting in the ever-skyrocketing
        unemployment rate over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The available ones cannot cater for everyone. The only ministry that has
        tried over the years to expand employment for graduates has been the
        education sector. This sector has managed to employ professionals and it
        is known to be the first and last hope for any graduates of any field of
        profession. The unfortunate part about all this is that most of these
        professionals are no longer employed on a permanent basis but on
        contracts. The reason behind this decision is hard to ascertain as the
        facts presented to the nation do not go hand in hand with what is on the
        ground. The government is adamant that there are no more posts to fill
        in schools whilst the schools say the complete opposite. This has badly
        affected the teachers' populace on contracts as these come with a lot of
        challenges in their workplace.
      </p>

      <div class="quote quote-color-blue dark">
        <p>
          "“They are doing the same duties in schools but are shamefully paid
          half.”"
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Some are underpaid, suffer some form of abuse, do not get to enjoy
        certain privileges enjoyed by their fellow colleagues employed on a
        permanent basis, amongst other things. One who was recently interviewed
        by some publication has come out and testified about the harsh
        experiences of contract teachers. He said:
      </p>

      <div class="quote light">
        <p>
          “Contract teachers are always treading on thin lines in the teaching
          profession. How? That is one simple question one could ask. The answer
          is simple, a contract teacher cannot easily challenge the headteacher
          even if he or she feels that his or her rights in the line of duty are
          somehow overlooked. This is because when the contract ends,
          headteachers are expected to fill forms that will determine that a
          certain contract teacher can get a renewal."
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="article-images">
        <img
          src="/images/Three african american happy successful mans at suit with diploma at g.webp"
          alt=""
          class="cover-image"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        This teacher expresses the fact that contract teachers often have to
        suffer a great deal in that they cannot speak their minds nor challenge
        those in power because if they did, chances of their contracts not being
        renewed would be high. And since there are a number of unemployed
        qualified individuals out there knocking on the door for the same
        position, firing them would not be a problem. He goes on to make a very
        disturbing revelation of one of his experiences as a contract teacher in
        his previous workplace.
      </p>

      <div class="quote light">
        <p>
          "A certain organisation once donated fruit trees and my previous
          school was one of the beneficiaries. I had to assist learners to dig
          the hard ground for planting to take place. My colleagues, who were
          permanent, just told the headteacher in no uncertain terms that they
          cannot spoil their dress code with dust. I, on the other hand, was
          obliged to spoil my smart dress code because I had to impress the
          headteacher so that when my contract elapsed, the impression I created
          would push her to recommend me to get another contract renewal.
          Nowadays teachers are hired on contract basis, yet they are
          professionals. They are doing the same duties in schools but are
          shamefully paid half.”
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="quote quote-color-brown dark">
        <p>
          "He did not let the end of his career be the end of his life nor his
          intelligence because regardless of the inequitable system, life must
          go on. "
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, this teacher's contract was not renewed at that school
        regardless of his massive efforts and dedication, which also proves how
        harsh and inconsiderate the system is on these professionals. Even
        though teaching was his passion, he was forced to look for other means
        of sustaining himself as now he was a qualified teacher with no job. He
        mentioned that he did think of using his writing skill which he had been
        nurturing over some time but was discouraged by the fact that art in
        this country is not given much respect and attention it deserves. It is
        more of an underrated talent and lacks support from the government and
        general populace. This therefore meant that he had to start searching
        for other means of survival.
      </p>

      <p>
        The plight of this man is very inspiring and enlightening. It is very
        instructive in the sense that even though life had dealt him this
        devastating blow, he did not give up. Two key points I want us to
        appreciate about this man are the beautiful mindset he had when tackling
        his circumstances and his formidable courage.
      </p>

      <div class="article-images">
        <img
          src="/images/image-aBlackManSmiling.webp"
          alt=""
          class="cover-image"
        />
      </div>

      <h3>His mindset:</h3>

      <p>
        This individual is very industrious and optimistic about his life. He
        did not let the fact that he is a graduate get into his head and way of
        creating a better life for himself. This is evident in that he was found
        in the town of Manzini working as a Mobile Money agent. It proves that
        he is innovative and will-powered. This man chose not to let his
        predicament destroy him or shun his light and passion for life which is
        why he became a mobile money agent. Most unemployed graduates would
        never stoop "so low". Why? Because to them, someone who is educated
        cannot be found on the streets hustling in this manner. The stereotype
        around this is that, only those who failed academically are expected to
        fill such positions, that these kinds of jobs are designed especially
        for them. One old saying says, when life gives you lemons, make
        lemonades out of those sour lemons. That is just how life goes, and this
        man did just that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wallowing in self-pity does not solve or make any situation better,
        instead it drowns you deep into depression and toxic behaviours.
        Self-pity does not pay the bills. It does not put food on the table.
        Yes, we cannot shy away from the fact that investing all those years of
        hard work and no sleep-in school, going through training for a job that
        in the end you do not get is extremely traumatic. As traumatic as this
        is, this man did not allow it to be the end of him. He picked himself up
        and made a plan. He took this positively such that he got to realize
        that losing his job actually freed him from a state of mind that most
        people who are working have. He described it as a routine or a vicious
        cycle that these employed individuals have fallen into.
      </p>

      <div class="quote quote-color-pink dark">
        <p>
          "Examples of an upward trajectory could be acquiring a language,
          sharpening a skill, becoming a better labourer, citizen, or letting go
          of a sleeping habit, drug or social media addiction and actually
          taking life more seriously."
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        He highlighted that most working people are totally clueless about their
        future, are not doing anything to improve and last – but most daunting –
        they do not have any touch of passion for what they are doing. He
        asserts that being unemployed gave him a chance to look at the bigger
        picture and saved him from falling into this dark hole. He further
        stated that when he gets home, instead of “resting”, like most 9am to
        5pm employees, he takes time to ponder on his future and gets an
        opportunity to sharpen his writing skills. This is astonishing because
        with such aggressiveness towards life, not only will one be able to
        improve his finances, but the country also stands to benefit.
      </p>

      <h3>Courage:</h3>

      <p>
        This man's courage is so exceptional and beautiful to watch. It is so
        moving that, in as much as it was painful for him to lose a job, he was
        so passionate about, he was wise enough to take it all in, and came up
        with a constructive plan to make his life less complicated. He did not
        let the end of his career be the end of his life nor his intelligence
        because regardless of the inequitable system, life must go on. There are
        needs to be met and they need money. If only each one of us would be so
        will-powered like this man, a lot could change for us where job creation
        is concerned. There is a lot one could take away from this man's plight.
        One significant thing would be to make each and every disappointment,
        pain, traumatic experiences our fuel in making the impossible possible.
        To create jobs for ourselves as seemingly the system is failing us.
      </p>

          src="/images/image-aGroupOfBlacksWorkingTogether.webp"

        />
      </div>

      <p>
        If we as a nation do not do away with the tendency of spending hours on
        our phones, on social media, in front of entertainment televisions and
        thereafter fall into slumber, we are destined for drastic failure.
        Waiting on the government to provide jobs will not change our lives,
        instead change will be brought about by us thinking out of the box and
        refusing to be boxed by stereotypes and social conventions. Let us not
        complicate our lives even further by these societal restrictions. They
        will not put food on our table, they will not pay that rent, they will
        not cater all these other demanding basic needs. As humiliating and
        painful as it may be to have to start all over again rebuilding your
        life starting from close to nothing, we just must try. This cannot be
        easily done but as a collective we could dare the impossible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone in the country should have a deep conversation with oneself and
        assess whether they are on an upward trajectory or not. Examples of an
        upward trajectory could be acquiring a language, sharpening a skill,
        becoming a better labourer, citizen, or letting go of a sleeping habit,
        drug or social media addiction and actually taking life more seriously.
        The enemy here is poverty. Playing the blame game and not actually
        taking part in creating these opportunities for ourselves will not make
        this fight a success. To those that have an opportunity to work at
        retail stores for instance and all the likes should gracefully take
        those jobs. Start saving up towards establishing those businesses. Join
        forces with others, be business partners, uplift each other and this
        way, more job creation is guaranteed. Let us stop being greedy
        individuals and actually work collectively to stop this vicious cycle of
        unemployment and poverty. It is really up to us whether we are willing
        to fight poverty or succumb to it. Whether we are willing to free
        ourselves from all the negatives and actually tackle this challenge of
        unemployment head on. Not to be so picky and discriminating when it
        comes to choosing jobs and not shaming each other whenever one has been
        ostracized by the system once again like that man. The time we realize
        this, getting better is not too far from our reach.
