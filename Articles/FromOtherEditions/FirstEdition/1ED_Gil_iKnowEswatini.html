        I know a country called Eswatini | Gil Sanders

      <p class="article-start">“Where are you from? Switzerland?”</p>

      <p>
        I never made this mistake. I say this so as not to brag or signal some
        kind of virtue or raise International awareness! No. The truth is, I
        could have easily made this mistake, trust me I would have if my friend
        Lelo hadn't introduced his country to me as the Kingdom of Eswatini. I
        remember having so many questions in my head “Where is Eswatini? What
        kind of music do they make, which language do they speak? Do Swati
        people have cultural values?” However, I remember being struck by a
        feeling stronger than all of my questions, a feeling that forced me to
        abandon myself in absolute silence despite the thousand unanswered
        questions bustling in my mind
      </p>

      <p>
        Why had I never heard of Eswatini before? It really had nothing to do
        with the novelty of the name, I had never heard of Swaziland either. And
        yet, I could not incriminate myself for my ignorance. I did not want to
        blame it on the lack of interest or on du <i>je m’en foutisme</i
        ><a href="#one"><sup>1</sup></a> . There must have been something
        bigger, something greater than me that predetermined my ignorance.
        Knowledge is political. I never had to look far to learn about western
        countries, they were all over the news for good and bad reasons, they
        successfully colonized the information, the media and the “culture” I
        was consuming.
      </p>

      <div class="article-images">
        <img
          src="/images/FifthEdition/Other/FirstEdition/Eswatini/image - a swazi girl.jpg"
          alt=""
          class="cover-image"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        I knew about the UK. I could not afford the luxury of not knowing where
        it was, what language the people spoke and what real British people were
        like. It was general culture! But Eswatini? Error 404. I did not know
        about the country, where it was or what its people looked like, I did
        not know the shape or colors of their flag, I did not know where it was,
        Why? It all started to make sense when people tried to convince me that
        it was okay not to know about Eswatini. They went to great lengths to
        justify my ignorance.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s a very small country. Landlocked”, they said. Yet, I knew of
        Luxembourg - also landlocked, with a total area 7 times smaller than
        that of Eswatini and almost half a million people less. What was my
        excuse?
      </p>

      <p>
        Knowledge is political. There was a reason I had never heard of
        Eswatini. Erasure is a powerful political tool, erasing a country from
        the books and the media gives you great power. You also erase its
        vibrant people, its unique history, its honorable struggles. You erase
        its fascinating culture and traditions, its catchy dances and delicious
        cuisine. You erase the rhythm at which his soul beats. Erasure allows
        you to discuss the humanity of humans. It enables debates around the
        authenticity of what is real. It allows you to wash the blood from your
        hands and gives you the agency to face the other way, ignoring your
        responsibility in the fate of an entire nation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eswatini will not be erased. Now that I know of this beautiful country,
        through me other people will know.
