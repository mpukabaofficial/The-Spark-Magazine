          article on the educational section of the second edition</a
        >, there is a necessity to dive in further into the mindset of
        approaching school. I truly believe that people are frustrated by
        school, and for now it is the only path I think should be taken by
        people who aren’t creative enough to live outside of school – including
        me. Although, I believe education should be a human enriching experience
        that helps people satisfy their curiosity not a commodity forced on to
        other people for survival. But that’s a topic for another day. This
        article also applies to people who are not in school. One of my
        instructors, who happened to be my advisor too, said to me, “I know you
        are a hard worker… but you need to start working smart.” Meanwhile, that
        day I was not feeling good at all, we had had a difficult conversation
        of how I am at the brink of failing. As she talked to me, I zoned out of
        the room and her voice became an echo as I replayed all the days I had
        ploughed through her assignment for hours, to no end. I thought that she
        must be kidding me, I have been losing sleep and sacrificing my other
        classes for this class, and all she had to say was that that class was
        easy; that I am spending more time than I should; or that I should work
        smart. My first thought was, “Am I dumb?” With proper explanation, at
        the end of the conversation I surrendered, the obvious choice was to
        change the way I think about her class, school and that completely
        obliterated my ego. Hard work always beats no work, but working smart
        surpasses them both! She was right, and my main takeaway was that it
        takes courage to work smart.
      </p>

        I felt numb and powerless as I exited the room, the way I had been
        working was the only way I knew how. My core assumptions of how things
        should have been like is illustrated by the following graph (click):

        Definitely something had to change, and drastically! Spending a lot of
        time on one thing would be unsustainable and an awful strategy towards
        success. However, I had a void: what would be my new strategy? It was
        going to be working smart! Working smart can be a feel-good phrase for
        some and it may imply the independence from hard work and that could be
        extremely deceiving. Sometimes working smart is working hard and no
        other way. The essential part of working smart is identifying the
        requirements and the proper strategies needed to accomplish the task at
        hand.

        What I did after that interaction is what determined my trajectory. I
        went back to the drawing board and decided to take a new approach to not
        only that course but my other classes and life. Things had to change or
        else. I started with a reflection by asking myself what I thought I was
        doing right, what I thought I was doing absolutely wrong and everything
        in between. Goal setting is fundamental in the way I function, so I had
        to write down my new goals. These included increasing focus and asking
        more questions which I thought would inevitably award better marks than
        what I was getting. Scheduling and goal setting are mutually inclusive.
        I planned the previous assignments that went terribly wrong, and I had
        to fix, and set exactly when I will be able to fix them. Ultimately, a
        positive attitude was essential in maintaining steady progress.
        Motivation was at an all-time low, but I had to keep pressing on. I was
        hopeful too: I thought that it would be essential to show up until the
        end. What was also crucial in my everyday life was maintaining
        composure, being relaxed helped me focus on one thing. This was not just
        an overnight transformation, but you can be shocked the resources one
        has if they have necessity, discipline and the courage to take a new
        perspective of learning. It takes courage to allow your beliefs to be
        challenged and furthermore – if you find the concept plausible – to
        adopt it. It takes courage to allow your ego to be set aside in order to
        attain an impeccable final product.

        People, especially in academia, have a toxic mindset of being
        individualistic. If a person has been told that they are smart or on the
        other extreme, that they are stupid, they adopt a culture of being
        individualistic. They think education comes naturally, and they will be
        able to figure it out themselves. Even the smartest person had to learn
        how to write their name at some point. There was a period in their lives
        where they had to scribble and draw shapes that even today they cannot
        repeat because there was no pattern, thought process or intellectual
        inference. They were just incapable of writing. The social media age has
        perpetuated the mindset of showing our best side and hiding our worst
        side. We are in an illusion that life can or will be perfect (some
        people do not do this with school, but in other areas of their lives).
        There is a façade brought up in attempt to appear “fine” in our own
        metrics of what fine is. It is hard to ask for help, or we choose to
        figure things out for ourselves. We slowly die inside until it is too
        late to recover. We need the courage to collaborate and eliminate the
        amount of time we spend studying and figuring things out.
      </p>

        Linked with the previous point, we as people hardly take advantage of
        the fact that people have achieved what we wish to achieve. Mentors are
        one of the highly effective assets we could have as we climb the ladder
        to our predetermined lives. It is very hard to do things ourselves. We
        need to be able to find someone who we can learn from, who can offer
        their perspectives as they know what works. It is true that things that
        work for one may not work for other people, but the chances are high
        enough. And mentors provide more than just advice, but they offer a key
        to success, which is accountability. If we are accountable to someone,
        we are more likely to do a particular task. Mentors are people you value
        and respect. It could be a colleague, your instructor, other people in
        academia and parents. Mentors offer support and enforce discipline among
        their mentees. Bottom line is that an effective mentor is someone who
        you have enough respect that you do what they say and put aside your
        ego. It takes courage to go out of your way and connect with people that
        could assist you. It takes courage to listen and to be coachable.
        Furthermore, it takes courage to work smart.
      </p>

        Ask questions. Always. Ask them during class as you acquire information
        or ask after class. Asking questions significantly reduces the amount of
        extra studying you need to do. Our instructors or teacher are there to
        be challenged by our series of questions. The state in which you truly
        understand a subject is one of the most blissful states one could be in
        and we tend to not experience it. It is very distressing that there are
        people who complete a course and they still do not get anything. They
        are just confused about their class. Learning has been humanity’s
        greatest strength and a confused mind is a stressed mind. Our curiosity
        keeps on increasing if we are actually learning. There are people who
        exist who stopped learning years ago but they now survive from class to
        class with no hope to ever be curious and that is apathetic. You can ask
        questions to a number of people: librarians, students and teaching
        assistants. It is important and time savvy. Take courage and work smart!
      </p>

        Part of working smart demands the discipline of not skipping a step.
        When you have a project, fundamentally, you need to break it down to
        actionable steps that are laid out linearly, one after the other. Take
        for example, if one needs to write an essay they tend to start writing
        the first draft which is the biggest mistake. That cannot produce a
        masterpiece. Especially because that first draft is usually written
        hours before the deadline. My instructor, the one I refer to earlier on,
        gave me this insight. Well, I cannot say it is an insight because it has
        been my life for the past 2 decades. That being said, the devil is in
        the details. She clearly insisted that when you tackle a small chunk of
        the whole project, your aim is to make the next step to be way easier
        than the one you are doing. For example, plan well enough to accommodate
        lazy days and unforeseen events. Read and take notes that will be easy
        to use. With all this care and discipline, the next step is inevitably
        simple. No one, however, can be this disciplined if they do not have a
        mentor or ask questions whether they are on the right track. This long
        process is impossible if you still try to do it by yourself or are still
        going to figure it out on your own. Asking a question in computer class
        could potentially save you 2 hours of trial and error. That is enough to
        write at least 2 pages of an essay. Think about it. Why do you need to
        work long and hard?. It takes courage to weigh your options and take on
        the path least travelled, which is starting early and being efficient in
        your approach. Starting on time gives you an ample amount of time to
        refine your work, and as the saying goes, “Wine improves with age.”

        I think this has happened only to me, for a long time I had been
        confused by what we were doing in my advisor's class. I just did the
        wrong assignments and did not even know what is due when. Likewise, I
        was just winging it. I am embarrassed thinking about that class because
        I just did not do the basic step, which was reading and understanding
        the tasks. This point is similar to the previous point, but I must
        emphasize it. Before you even proceed with planning, breaking down the
        task or taking necessary actions – understand the task. Clear out
        everything that you do not understand by simply asking questions. There
        is no other way. Work the instructions thoroughly before you start the
        task. You could translate it, you can write it in your own words, or you
        could annotate it or anything but make sure it is clear what you are
        supposed to do. You can even ask for strategies of how to go about it –
        if need be. Once you clear that out, you can start working on it. Ensure
        you know the main requirements and what skills are graded. Be clear in
        your head, then the whole process will be smoother. Prepare yourself
        first, do not just jump right in. This could differ in other areas of
        your life, but the fundamentals are knowing what is being required and
        what is important in achieving good results.
      </p>

      <p>
        As stated above, working smart is not synonymous with working easy
        because sometimes you need to get your hands dirty and do the
        unpleasurable tasks. I have already highlighted that working smart could
        also mean working hard and as long as you realize that is the strategy
        that is required in a particular instance. You need to do the tasks that
        most people productively procrastinate. You may even spend more time
        than what most people do but having two sets of notes where everyone has
        one, but this is a strategy. It is deliberate action. One set of notes
        are just random things that you thought could be useful, and they are
        layout according to the sequence of the book. The secondary notes could
        be those which are polished and structured in a way that suits your
        essay. You may also need to follow the rules of writing and even, in
        some cases, evaluate each sentence. But if you have a clear direction
        and plan, you might as well have every task done accordingly. It takes
        courage to persevere in the laborious tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, we could ask ourselves, “How could I learn?” The simple
        answer is that we could work smart. Working smart, gives you the optimal
        results at a fraction of time. Working smart is not as easy as it is
        portrayed, but it is necessary. If some of the principles highlighted
        above can be translated to other areas in life – where they are
        applicable – one should do so. It is time for emaSwati to strive into
        working smart so that they get to achieve better results. It is time for
        you to take courage by learning the principle of working smart.
