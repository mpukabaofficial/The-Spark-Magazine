          “Work hard and you will be successful in life.” Where do I even begin? This has been thoroughly engrained in our society such that it is as true as the laws of physics. What is saddening is that I have been part of these already dominant people who think they are smarter than everyone else who are in underprivileged positions. What is disheartening is that some of those people in dire situation also believe that they are less brilliant. All of this is total stupidity and lack of wisdom – especially to those who are in the privileged club. We are engulfed by a system that is ever guaranteeing that we stay in this absurdity. To make it easier for you to understand, a homeless person is as capable as the millionaires that assume they deserve a spot at the pinnacle of the human hierarchy made up of greed and brutality.

              The first question is: Why is everyone supposed to work hard in life? Is it the way things are? Is it the law of nature or maybe a God given mandate that we are supposed to subscribe to?

          Let’s analyse the quote mentioned above: “Work hard and you will be successful in life.” The first question is: Why is everyone supposed to work hard in life? Is it the way things are? Is it the law of nature or maybe a God given mandate that we are supposed to subscribe to? I already know I have gone too far for most people. I would advise you to keep on reading this article because there are important things we need to understand. No one is supposed to work in order to survive. It’s that simple. We are a community of humans, and we are supposed to make sure that we grant survival to all our members. No negotiation. Every human deserves their rights, as humans, to be granted. Now, lets assess whether it is necessary for people to work hard. As contributing members of our human society, we need to ensure a sustainable future for humans and that can be achieved by the constant innovation in solving problems for our race. Not necessarily to profit off other people’s hard work.

          I have been constantly looking at myself in the mirror – confidently – thinking that I deserve what I have. Also, the quote guarantees people that if their work is hard enough, they will be successful. Do I really deserve my success and what does that mean? First of all, the guarantee that people will become successful is a strategy to keep the working class working tirelessly. But that is not the most sinister perspective of this part of the quote. Do I work? Yes. Do I work hard? That’s a different story, I know people who – when in my position – would totally burry me in hard work. I am a less than average worker and even if I was that hard working, it does not guarantee, justify, and qualify me to have a better life yet people are suffering. No human is supposed to be denied the ability to live a good and stable life. Also, people are not rewarded for how much they work, no matter what anyone can tell you. There is a large group of people who work twice as hard as their employers but still do not make a percent of what their employers earn. Have people worked hard and achieved success (whatever that means)? Yes, a lot. What is sinister is that a lot of people are rich because of hard work, but in proportion, more people are suffering while other people have no room to store the wealth they have accumulated.

          In the quote, success is the cherry on top! We have been sold the mindset of individualism that finds comfort in having a decent life. Nonsense. What about other people? Success has been the drive for greed, classism, and inhumane acts towards other fellow humans. One may say, “If I give everyone everything how will I survive?” The fact that we are okay for people to be poor, to suffer, or even die – when we know we could possibly make a positive change – is part of a bigger problem. I am one of those people. The arrogance is addictive. It is nothing short of a drug. Seeing people below us satisfies the thought that we are better. It is a constant addiction that feeds on people’s suffering and pain. We are constantly being sold on the idea that it is up to us to be rich and everyone can do it. Which is false. I am where I am because of many events lining up, not forgetting the conducive environment my parents gave to me. I cannot even point to a single event or decision that resulted to what I am and have. Even if I could, that should not make me inherently better than a person sleeping on the streets because as a society have decided that we would rather reward the “smart” people than the lazy scraps along the streets. What if someone isn’t smart? What if a whole family isn’t smart? Are they supposed to scramble for food and housing whilst the elite sit on their thrones, hoard ridiculous amounts of wealth, and eat buffet all day? Really?

          The incredibly appalling thing is that generations have been sold on this. We are all humans, and our first need is to survive. Actually, it is our right to survive. Everyone needs to have a roof over their head, by default; everyone needs food, clothes, and water, by default. In our modernised age, people are entitled to health, education, and public services – also by default! No one is better than another human being. We shouldn’t be working for our survival; we should be working to enrich the human experience. I am no saint, but now that you and I know, we need to make a change. Let us have a truer guarantee: that we will look after our fellow humans. Let us prevent the elitist mindset defer us from our ultimate role. Humans are social beings and that is what, on top of our developed brain, has gave us dominance over the earth. But we have forgotten each other, and we are pitting against each other because of a system that is totally not working out.
