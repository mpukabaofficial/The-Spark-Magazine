      <h1 class="article-title">The Violation of Women's Rights</h1>
      <p class="article-date">Last edited: June 2, 2022</p>
      <p class="article-start">
        What is a right? It is a moral or legal entitlement to have or obtain
        something or to act in a certain way. What are equal human rights? It is
        the idea that everyone has the same rights and deserves the same level
        of respect. This means that laws, policies and programs should not be
        discriminatory and also those public authorities should not apply or
        enforce laws, policies and programs in a discriminatory way. The issue
        on rights is a national emergency that has been addressed for many
        generations before us. This article is based on a survey conducted by
        asking both males and females on their views on Women's rights, as I
        believe it has come to the point where we allow people the platform to
        express their views.

          >1. Where are women most likely to have their rights violated?</span
        >
        The most common situation or setting where women rights are violated is
        in a romantic relationship. Relationships are supposed to be a safe
        space for both partners to grow mentally and emotionally through the
        support of the next partner but, in most instances, this is not the
        case. women tend to find themselves cornered into doing things they are
        uncomfortable with, with the aim of trying to please their partner and
        in-laws if in a marriage. These kinds of violations may include women
        putting up with abuse like forced sex (rape), financial constraints,
        being beaten up, which is a case that we have been dealing with as a
        society for a long time.

          >2. What is the root cause for women getting violated?</span
        >
        Most people felt women are violated because of the entitlement man have
        over them. Society has shaped the way a man sees and treats a woman and
        they have been taught at a young stage that men are superior demanding
        authority. If some are deprived they tend to take it by force which
        leads to cases of Gender Based Violence. Women in poverty is one of the
        causes of their violation in the sense that women find themselves in
        situations where they tolerate violence because they get monetary
        benefits from it. Just recently social media was going wild over recent
        findings that some women allow man to use them as sex slaves in Dubai in
        order for them to make money and feed their families and have a proper
        lifestyle.

          >3. How Do We Address the Gender Gaps in STEM (Science, Technology,
          Engineering, Mathematics) And Executive Careers?</span
        >
        Women have taken matters in their own hands when it comes to addressing
        the inequalities in the STEM and executive careers. Women are getting
        degrees and PHDs in the field’s society raised them to think they were
        not smart enough to take on. When one takes a closer look at the number
        of women over men in schools you would note that there are more educated
        women over men. Even though a point was raised that in most instances
        the qualifications that women hold is brushed off in certain companies
        because they still hold the stigma that women are not capable. A way we
        could address this issue is target the young generation and educate them
        on how women are just as capable as men in all fields of work especially
        in the sciences and executives. In the meantime, it was suggested that
        women should start building their own empires where they can recruit
        more women that way, they get the power they deserve.

          >4. Should Women Have Access to Non-Prescription Birth Control?</span
        >
        Over the counter birth controls were highly supported by both men and
        females on the view that morning after pills is easily accessible and
        they act as a birth control and other birth control should be just as
        accessible both pills and injections. Although there were some
        contradictions on this issue based on the side effects that come with
        the use of contraceptives some felt that condoms and basic abstinence
        should be the most advised forms of birth control to avoid cases where
        women bleed uncontrollably, severe headaches, weight gain/loss and skin
        problems to name a few.

        <span class="emphasis line-break"
          >5. What Access Should Women Have to Abortion Clinics?</span
        >
        The issue of women having access to abortion clinics was tricky and most
        people were against allowing women to get abortions especially when it
        comes to consensual sexual intercourse. We all know that not all women
        fall pregnant as a result of sexual relations within a healthy
        relationship, some pregnancies are a result of rape. such a service
        should be provided for rape victims because their rights have been
        violated or people tend to have complications during pregnancies such as
        ectopic pregnancy which could be a health risk to the mother. It is
        advised that one should prevent using a condom and other contraceptives
        or something that is 100% effective which is simply abstaining. However,
        some felt Women should have full access to safe and well-regulated
        abortion clinics. Things don't always go according to plan, so they do
        deserve to make their own choices but after being advised first by a
        therapist and a health care personnel as an abortion can be just as
        traumatic as an unplanned pregnancy.

          >6. How Do We Address the Current High Rates of Sexual Violence Toward
          Women?</span
        >
        At this point the only way to fight against this evil is to fight fire
        with more fire. Make rape sentences very harsh because rapists are
        comfortable with violating women as they know that they will get bail
        for E2000 (roughly $134) which is not a pinch at all. The laws of the
        country are without doubt required taking the matter women being
        violated as a sense of emergency, just early in the month of May UNESWA
        students have been sexually harassed in their room the early hours of
        the morning by an unknown suspect at knife point and it took the police
        3 hours to reach the scene and till today the suspects have not been
        found. Imposing corrective action at school, workplace, communities, and
        homes. These include, demotion, expulsion, arresting the suspects,
        leaving toxic environments young men and women should be educated on
        this matter and victims should be provided with counselling and therapy
        sessions. Confidential channels that women can use to report such cases
        should be available as some are afraid to report their abusers for them
        to be comfortable enough to open up
      </p>

          >7. What Is Something That Has Been Overshadowed When It Comes to
          Women's Rights?</span
        >
        Women are not given the credit they deserve in workplaces, relationships
        and everyday life. Men take all the credit. Women's efforts are always
        overshadowed especially when they are working in an environment that is
        dominant by men. women's voices are not heard, they are dismissed most
        of the time and their side of the story is never heard. The fact that
        women own their bodies, and they have every right to do as they want and
        choose what is right for them. We need to start listening more and stop
        dictating on what they should and should not do especially when it come
        to their dress code. For some dress is a way of self expression and when
        society pushes women into a corner with rules on what to wear where when
        and why we are denying them freedom of expression which a basic human
        right. Rape in relationships, just because someone is your partner does
        not automatically give them consent, most women are raped by their
        lovers and all anyone can say is "How can he rape you, he’s your
        boyfriend “Another issue is that of drunken consent. there is no such
        thing, a drunk woman has no consent to give, you have sex with her, you
        raped her, especially if she doesn't even know you.

        This survey on Women's rights Is a piece to bring to light what people
        think on the subject matter. It is a piece aimed at raising a debate
        within oneself and actually thinking about if the way women are treated
        in society is a way one should be living?
