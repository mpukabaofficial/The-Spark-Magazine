        The girlies closet is a clothing business establishment by Siphesihle
        Qwabe in 2020.
      </p>
      <p class="article-start">What inspired you to start your own business?</p>
      <p>
        The reason why I started my business was simply because I had just
        completed high school and was looking for something to keep me busy
        while also giving me an income. Surprisingly the business grew so well
        and I started getting a lot of customers.
      </p>

          alt="A picture of a black woman sitting on a chair wearing yellow dress"
          class="cover-image top-crop"
        />
      </div>

      <p class="article-start">
        What is you business about, what do you produce?
      </p>

      <p>
        Our products include summer dresses , leggings , fashionable tops, wide
        leg sets and a variety of other beautiful clothes. When I started the
        business , we specialised only in cotton made clothes but we have
        recently added a silk range to add variety and to make sure our
        customers have a great variety to choose from.

        What have been your accomplishments since you started?
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2020 , we were only an online store depending on meeting points in
        towns to deliver our products to our customers then in late 2021 we got
        an office space which is one of our biggest accomplishments thus far. We
        now have an office space in Mbabane where our customers can view our
        products and buy , collect orders and also place new orders at the
        store. This has also created employment for a girl child in Eswatini.

          alt="A picture of a black woman sitting on a chair wearing yellow dress"
          class="cover-image top-crop"
        />
      </div>

      <p class="article-start">What is you vision for the future?</p>

      <p>
        My biggest goal is to improve my products and my customer service in
        every way possible so that I see my business growing impressively. In
        the next coming years , the girlies closet will be one of the biggest
        brands in the country and hopefully internationally with multiple shops!
