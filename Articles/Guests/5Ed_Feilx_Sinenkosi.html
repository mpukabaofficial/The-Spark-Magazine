        <p class="article-start">
            Imagine a world in which Photography doesn’t exist; where beautiful and magical moments pass us by without being captured and frozen in time; a world where one would only rely on their brain to store memories and events. I think we can all agree that Photography is one of the best inventions of all time since it has enabled us to freeze moments in time – both sad and happy. We are able to keep memories of ourselves and other people – including those who are no longer with us: pictures will always keep them in colour when they begin to fade in our minds. Ed Sheeran sings: “We keep this love in a photograph | We made these memories for ourselves | Where our eyes are never closing | Hearts are never broken | Times forever frozen still.” In this edition, The Spark Magazine gets close and personal with Felix Dlamini and Sinenkosi Msomi who are both photographers in the Kingdom of eSwatini. Read along and get to know about their interesting journey in the field of Photography, and how they adjust their focus when life gets a little blurry.

            How would you describe yourselves?
        </p>
        <p class="felix">
            Felix Dlamini: I am a versatile, self taught photographer born and raised in the Kingdom of eSwatini. I attained a Post graduate degree in Medical Laboratory Sciences from SANU (Southern Africa Nazarene University) and I am currently a medical practitioner.  
        </p>
        <p class="msomi">
            Sinenkosi Msomi:  I’m an NFT artist, visual artist and photographer born and raised at Lobamba in the Kingdom of Eswatini. I have attained a degree in Business Management from Limkokwing University and I am currently majoring in Marketing at the University of Eswatini.

            What fuelled the love for Photography? 
        </p>
        <p class="felix">
            Felix Dlamini: Having an innate ability to fix things drew me into processing of photos, and editing. Getting an opportunity to work with a photographer inspired me to start my own journey in Photography.  To fully express the ideas I had, I established finest visuals, instead of expressing other people’s ideas about Photography. 
        </p>
        <p class="msomi">
            Sinenkosi Msomi:  In 2017, I discovered my love for Photography after being amongst the winners of Eswatini Beverages kick-start initiative. This recognition gave me the platform to work on my craft daily, grow as an individual, while moving closer to my calling. 
        </p>

          Your biggest supporters?  
        </p>

        <p class="felix">
          Felix Dlamini: I believe that strangers have supported me without a doubt, those who know me only support me when they see me do well. My friends, however, are my greatest supporters. 
        </p>
        <p class="msomi">
          Sinenkosi Msomi: My mother is my biggest supporter of my craft. She has and is still my strongest support system because she always encourages me to be the best version of myself.

        <p class="article-start">
          What is the one thing you wish you  knew when you started Photography? 
        </p>

        <p class="felix">
          Felix Dlamini: I wish I knew how to set the white balance because, once it is off, the end results are unrealistic. I would advice other aspiring photographers to get a grey card and use to match scene white balance; an alternative is being good at remembering the colours of the scene so that editing is easier. 
        </p>
        <p class="msomi">
          Sinenkosi Msomi: This will be a little bit different: I wish I was aware enough to realize that the pictures I take reflect my perception of the world. People can observe the things my attention is fixated on because that is how I tell my story.
        </p>

          How did you get good at Photography?
        </p>

        <p class="felix">
          Felix Dlamini: My secret to being good was first getting to understand the Science and Technology of Photography. I then listened to my own expression of art. Most importantly, passion is the biggest force that drives me to be the best at what I do. I believe that, when I attained an award for Best Online Photography Portfolio in 2020, I had gotten good.
        </p>
        <p class="msomi">
          Sinenkosi Msomi: I believe what has made me to be great at Photography has been staying true to my own theme and approach. Also, I am constantly learning new skills and putting them to practice. This sharpens my skills so that I become really good.
        </p>

        <p class="article-start">
          What equipment do you use? 
        </p>

        <p class="felix">
          Felix Dlamini: I currently do not own a camera. The truth is that the best equipment to produce good Photography is the photographer. I only own a 64gb SD card, a Computer and myself of course; I am able to deliver when needed with what I have.
        </p>
        <p class="msomi">
          Sinenkosi Msomi: I currently own a Canon 7D.

          Which lens is your favourite?
        </p>

        <p class="felix">
          Felix Dlamini: The lens closest to my heart are the Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 DG OS HSM Art lens as they are versatile. They are suitable for most settings and types of shots without compromising the quality and resolution of the picture. In the future, I would like to own a Sigma 50mm  F/1.4 DG HSM Art lens for Canon cameras.
        </p>
        
        <p class="msomi">
          Sinenkosi Msomi: I believe my favourite lens to be the 75-300mm or the zoom lens because it fits perfectly with my creative photography.

          What challenges have you faced in your journey and how do you deal with them?
        </p>

        <p class="felix">
          Felix Dlamini: I am responsible for organizing sessions and dealing with security intellectual property rights, and sometimes settings that could produce perfect shots are considered out of bounds and illegal and it is very frustrating. However, the weather tops it all off! Weather is the biggest plan changer. If we had planned a shot that requires sunlight, the weather can just act up and we have to replan and it is a big hassle. With experience, I have learnt to adapt to these challenges by staying up to date with the weather and researching whether we are allowed to take shots in a desired location.
        </p>

        <p class="msomi">
          Sinenkosi Msomi: The challenges I have faced in my journey has to be attaining growth as I evolve as a photographer and visual artist. It has enabled me to become a great leader and giving it my all to see my dream through. Other challenges that I have faced is losing my identity for what I do. Of course I am a photographer but before that I am Sinenkosi Msomi. Adopting a mentality that pushes me to always stand up when I fall and embracing positivity in every testing situation has enable me to grow as a brand internationally.

          Whose work has influenced you most and why?
        </p>

        <p class="felix">
          Felix Dlamini: I draw inspiration from shotsbyngezi a talented photographer from our very own Kingdom and from outside the country is stephenobi.Jpg. When I come across the work of stephenobi.Jpg I get to appreciate the significance of the being unique as a photographer. Having individuality is always the right way to draw a crowd because people like to see things that new and different and the above mentioned photographer always have unexpected content.
        </p>

        <p class="msomi">
          Sinenkosi Msomi: My work is influenced by a lot of amazing photographers who let the camera project both the most beautiful and the most painful hidden fabrics of the journey we call life. My inspiration comes from photographers such as Thembinkosi Hlatshwayo, Trevor stuurman, ariostories, thedarkroomartist, zanele muholi, andile bhala. Art, for me, is always the reflection of what we see in our everyday life and each one of us have different perspective and that is what has kept art alive.

          How would you respond to the situation when a client is unhappy with your work? 
        </p>

        <p class="felix">
          Felix Dlamini: It is said that the customer is always right. When I find myself in a sticky situation I assess the situation to find the root cause of the problem. I assess the situation because sometimes the situation can be fixed for example, over editing, less edition and picture resolution. In more serious cases, I suggest that we have schedule retake sessions because the happiness of the customer should always be number one and that helps maintain the reputation of the business.
        </p>

        <p class="msomi">
          Sinenkosi Msomi: I believe that when a client is unhappy you have to use that positively; instead of being angry, take that as constructive criticism. Feedback enables one to grow and without it one will stay in the same position.

          What gig would you get that you would consider as your big break? 
        </p>

        <p class="felix">
          Felix Dlamini: Some of my major dreams is being able to shoot for corporate events, the Luju Festival, MTN Bushfire, Durban July and Fashion Week. I will not stop until I accomplish that and I believe I have the potential to become the very best.
        </p>

        <p class="msomi">
          Sinenkosi Msomi: It seems like I already have been getting a number of “big breaks” but can one get enough? My big breaks start from taking part in the 2017 Eswatini Beverages Kick-start Initiate awards, to being an influence in The Young Independents SADC top 100 of 2019. I have also been represented by Yebo Art Gallery which has played a major role in my career between 2019 and 2021. I have also been featured on the on the Knack Magazine from the United States and Refresh Magazine from the United Kingdom. My unique approach has let me to being awarded The African Union × Afrochampions nerfetiti Social Justice price during the first ever Africa integration day.

          Advice you can give to young upcoming artists?
        </p>

        <p class="felix">
          Felix Dlamini: Stay emerging! By this I mean that you need to constantly be doing research on the craft because knowledge is power. Also you need to collaborate because you can learn valuable Photography techniques from other photographers. 
        </p>

        <p class="msomi">
          Sinenkosi Msomi: Every photographer is very distinct so it is also wise to never compete with other photographers but make sure you stand out through the work you create. What is meant for you will surely find you!

          Sinenkosi Msomi: If you are a lover of art you can check out my content via <a href="https://latitudes.online/artists/sinenkosi_msomi">latitudes.online</a> and via Afrikanzim art platform from Angola – soon to have a physical space in Portugal. I also make NFTs thanks to 1Macollective, which is a collective of African artists trying to bring awareness on African Culture through the sale of NFTs of these following platforms KnownOrigin, Object and opensea.
