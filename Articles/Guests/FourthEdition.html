              <p class="bold">The girlies closet is a clothing business establishment by Siphesihle Qwabe in 2020. </p>
                <p class="bold questionaire">Q: What inspired you to start the business?</p>
                <p>The reason why I started my business was simply because I had just completed high school and was looking for something to keep me busy while also giving me an income. Surprisingly, the business grew so well and I started getting a lot of customers. </p>
            <p class="bold questionaire">Q: What are your main products?</p>
                <p>Our products include summer dresses , leggings , fashionable tops, wide leg sets and a variety of other beautiful clothes. When I started the business , we specialised only in cotton made clothes but we have recently added a silk range to add variety and to make sure our customers have a great variety to choose from. </p>

                        alt=""
                        class="hero-articles--background"
                      />

                    <p class="fine-print">The Girlies Closet</p>
                  </div>
                </a>
                

            <p class="bold questionaire">Q: What are your accomplishments ever since you started?</p>
            <p>In 2020 , we were only an online store depending on meeting points in towns to deliver our products to our customers then in late 2021 we got an office space which is one of our biggest accomplishments thus far. We now have an office space in Mbabane where our customers can view our products and buy, collect orders and also place new orders at the store. This has also created employment for a girl child in Eswatini. </p>

            
            <div class="quotes">
              <p class="quotes-words">
                "This has also created employment for a girl child in Eswatini."
              </p>
            </div>
            

            <p class="bold questionaire">Q: What are your future ambitions?</p>
            <p>My biggest goal is to improve my products and my customer service in every way possible so that I see my business growing impressively. In the next coming years , the girlies closet will be one of the biggest brands in the country and hopefully internationally with multiple shops!</p>
