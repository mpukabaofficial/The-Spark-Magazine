          Seeing the world through a different eye and connecting with one's
          inner being is what Writer and Artist Lusanda believes to be the
          foundation of her writing and music. <br /><br />Falling in love with
          the littlest details of the world is an important aspect in her life
          as she expresses these through photography and music; during the last
          month of 2020 she released a single along side producer
          Thasco_lepara_Music titled "Ngifuna Wena" which managed to score the
          number one spotÂ  on Jelele FMs "Top February Amapaiano Songs" she has
          since released two other singles up for streaming on SoundCloud and
          Audiomac and is soon to release an EP aswell. <br /><br />Lusanda will
          soon venture into abstract painting as she is a hands on person who
          believes in diversity in her craft and with paintings she believes she
          will be able to give her audience the power to give the paintings an
          analysis and make out of them want the painting speaks to them. She
          has previously proven to be fond of color through her TieDye business
          @TiedyeKing on instragam and she expanding from there.<br />
          With her currently pursuing a B. A Humanities Degree in African
          Languages and Theology and Religious Studies she is a critical thinker
          and a lover of unity in cultures.
